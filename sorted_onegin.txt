``Olga,'' she thinks, ``what fate befell her?
Olga's adorer comes a-wooing.
Olga's appeared upon the scene,
Olga's no life in her regard:
Olinka and her mother sent:
Olinka yawned, just like her neighbour,
Omens dismayed her with their presage;
on a fast stallion from the Don,
on a small bench by Tanya's bed,
on a small table's oilcloth sheen
On an old aunt, who's long been burning
on ballroom's looking-glass parquet
on billiard-table rests a cue,
on Christmas Eve, he wished me joy:
on cups of coffee, and then later
on dance-floor, at breakup of ball,
on dining-chairs are all prostrated;
on Eugene, he was deeply stirred:
on Eugene's lips. In his dejection,
on features known, but to that dreary,
on Finland's coast a lonely rover --
on foot, by seven o'clock, until
on goose's neck, a skull looks cheerful
on her conquest, we leave my sweet;
on her smug face a flush of pleasure.
on jam, and speeches in regard
on kennels, and on kith and kin,
on liquor, and on hay brought in,
on me, all this has no effect:
on modish malice, coarse of grain
on most occasions between friends,
on my untimely urn be weeping,
on Olga; from heart's ache still spared,
(on orders which of course presume
on points that all long since agree --
on Richardson gone raving mad.

on stage are thumping without cease;
on state affairs; there was a wit,
On such indifference, such forgetting
on the cotillion, as amends.
on the dull life that bachelors lead;
On the first sheet you'll find a question:
on the highroad the wolves come out;
On the seashore, with storm impending,
On these, with something like obsession,
on this unstable life, my friends!
On this we'll part; goodbye again!
on tragedy; but it's no joke,
on unknown ladies in the tiers;
on visits to us, and in greeting
on waves of far niente floated,
on which a carpet has been spread,
on which the world is doomed to spin.
On whom alone can we depend?

Once home, he brought out and inspected
once I too liked it very much;
once more, at that beloved sight,
once more Corneille's majestic story;
once more he can't await the night;
Once more he counts the hour-bells tolling,
Once more he turned to books, unchoosing,
once more renounces world and din.
once more that touch is fiercely troubling
once more the love, once more the smart...
once on the highway he'd detected
Once Vyazemsky, who chanced to find her
once, with its foaming and its playing,
one customary grief each hour!
one customary object gleaming,
one day came down that lonely turning,
one finds in war amusing sport,
one leads the multitude in thought,
one listened to a chief of mission
One melancholy fop, declaring
one pair! I pay them memory's tribute
one raves in verse like me, and one
one sees a duck and aims his gun,
one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
one thing inspired his breath, his heart,
one wallows in delicious weeping;
``One winter's worth, you've surely got;
Onegin -- now once more my theme --
Onegin comes, and makes excuses;
Onegin, drenched with sudden chill,
Onegin, d'you recall the day
Onegin had no word to say;
Onegin has outrun us all.
Onegin knew enough to savour
Onegin looks with eyes of fire:
Onegin, my good friend, was littered
Onegin sits at table too,
Onegin spoke about its flights
Onegin still is slumbering deeply.
Onegin swiftly came to know
Onegin too -- and there to see,
Onegin too. ``Good Lord, at last!''
Onegin turns, and with a shiver
Onegin was assessed by many
Onegin wastes, you'd almost find
Onegin without more ado

Onegin's life, you see, was holy;
Onegin's soul encountered there
Onegin's waiting on the ground.''

that lives, and glitters, and endears,
that marble Nina's proved unable
that, meanwhile, pinched and glum of feature,
that mediocre dress alone

that modish rings were still a-buying.

that on the world's staircase there waited

That point I wouldn't mind contesting,
that poison brew; and in your mind
that poisonous worm, despised, degrading,
that queen of secrets and of sighing.

that table where the lamp has languished,

that there his friend Kaverin's waiting;
that thievish mouths cannot consume

I thank him without reservation,

The kinsfolk in concerted action
of Russian verse, its force in action, --
with shelves of books deployed for action,

of childish pranks: a chilled reaction

The nervous-tragical reaction,
the quintessential reaction

the brilliant crackpot: this reaction

A pause of silence and inaction,

what dream accounts for her distraction?

Tatyana never knew the attraction
It's true, the magnet-like attraction
But you perhaps find no attraction
In time past, objects of affection
I grasp a stirrup with affection,
I gave no rein to sweet affection:
I feel a brotherly affection,
with such a blissful, brief infection --
Whatever in this rough confection
showed one a pattern of perfection
the universe is all perfection;
arrested by the sheer perfection
and always the self-same objection;
on Eugene's lips. In his dejection,
for him all sham has found rejection,
I've drawn a plan and a projection,
and charming reverie's vain deflection
the man of reverie and reflection,
what holds her in profound reflection,
is lost in obstinate reflection;
almanacs, journals of reflection,

Walking her horse in introspection

Dogs, howling, rushed in her direction...

I must wake up with the conviction
Tatyana shared with full conviction

The chateau was of a construction
I know it's now in your discretion
How soft his glance, or at discretion
I would have had the indiscretion
untouched by trace of inhibition,

I've learnt the voice of new ambition,

The Larins kept the old tradition:
