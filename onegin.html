<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``My uncle -- high ideals inspire him;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but when past joking he fell sick,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he really forced one to admire him --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and never played a shrewder trick.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let others learn from his example!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But God, how deadly dull to sample
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sickroom attendance night and day
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and never stir a foot away!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of entertaining the half-dead:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and glumly serves the medicine bottle,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "When will the devil come for you?"''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {35}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; II
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such were a young rake's meditations --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by will of Zeus, the high and just,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the legatee of his relations --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as horses whirled him through the dust.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; without preliminary feeler
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; let me acquaint you on the nail
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with this the hero of my tale:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin, my good friend, was littered
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and bred upon the Neva's brink,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where you were born as well, I think,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reader, or where you've shone and glittered!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There once I too strolled back and forth:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but I'm allergic to the North...<a href="#fn_6_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; III
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After a fine career, his father
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had only debts on which to live.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He gave three balls a year, and rather
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; promptly had nothing left to give.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at first Madame gave him tuition,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from her Monsieur took on the child.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Monsieur l'Abbe, the mediocre,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reluctant to exhaust the boy,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; treated his lessons as a ploy.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No moralizing from this joker;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a mild rebuke was his worst mark,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and then a stroll in Letny Park.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {36}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But when the hour of youthful passion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; struck for Evgeny, with its play
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of hope and gloom, romantic-fashion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it was goodbye, Monsieur l'Abbe.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eugene was free, and as a dresser
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; made London's <i>dandy</i> his professor.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His hair was fashionably curled,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and now at last he saw the World.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In French Onegin had perfected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; proficiency to speak and write,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the mazurka he was light,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his bow was wholly unaffected.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The World found this enough to treat
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eugene as clever, and quite sweet.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; V
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We all meandered through our schooling
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; haphazard; so, to God be thanks,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it's easy, without too much fooling,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to pass for cultured in our ranks.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin was assessed by many
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (critical judges, strict as any)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as well-read, though of pedant cast.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unforced, as conversation passed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he had the talent of saluting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; felicitously every theme,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of listening like a judge-supreme
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while serious topics were disputing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or, with an epigram-surprise,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of kindling smiles in ladies' eyes.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {37}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now Latin's gone quite out of favour;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet, truthfully and not in chaff,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin knew enough to savour
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the meaning of an epigraph,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; make Juvenal his text, or better
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; add <i>vale</i> when he signed a letter;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stumblingly call to mind he did
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; two verses of the Aeneid.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He lacked the slightest predilection
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for raking up historic dust
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or stirring annalistic must;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but groomed an anecdote-collection
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that stretched from Romulus in his prime
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; across the years to our own time.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was without that dithyrambic
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; frenzy which wrecks our lives for sound,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and telling trochee from iambic
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was quite beyond his wit, we found.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He cursed Theocritus and Homer,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in Adam Smith was his diploma;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our deep economist had got
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the gift of recognizing what
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a nation's wealth is, what augments it,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and how a country lives, and why
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it needs no gold if a supply
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of <i>simple product</i> supplements it.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His father failed to understand
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and took a mortgage on his land.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {38}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Evgeny's total store of knowledge
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have no leisure to recall;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where he was master of his college,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the art he'd studied best of all,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his young heyday's supreme employment,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its work, its torture, its enjoyment,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what occupied his chafing powers
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; throughout the boredom of the hours --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this was the science of that passion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which Ovid sang, for which the bard,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; condemned to a lifetime of hard,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ended his wild career of fashion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; deep in Moldavia the abhorred,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; far, far from Italy, his adored.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (IX,<a href="#fn_6_2"><sup>2</sup></a>) X
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How early he'd learnt to dissemble,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to hide a hope, to make a show
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of jealousy, to seem to tremble
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or pine, persuade of yes or no,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and act the humble or imperious,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the indifferent, or the deadly serious!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In languid silence, or the flame
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of eloquence, and just the same
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in casual letters of confession --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one thing inspired his breath, his heart,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and self-oblivion was his art!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How soft his glance, or at discretion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how bold or bashful there, and here
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how brilliant with its instant tear!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {39}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How well he donned new shapes and sizes --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; startling the ingenuous with a jest,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; frightening with all despair's disguises,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; amusing, flattering with the best,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stalking the momentary weakness,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with passion and with shrewd obliqueness
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; swaying the artless, waiting on
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for unmeant kindness -- how he shone!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then he'd implore a declaration,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and listen for the heart's first sound,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pursue his love -- and at one bound
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; secure a secret assignation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then afterwards, alone, at ease,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; impart such lessons as you please!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How early on he learnt to trouble
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the heart of the professional flirt!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When out to burst a rival's bubble,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how well he knew the way to hurt --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what traps he'd set him, with what malice
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he'd pop the poison in his chalice!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But you, blest husbands, to the end
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you kept your friendship with our friend:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the subtle spouse was just as loyal --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Faublas'<a href="#fn_6_3"><sup>3</sup></a> disciple for an age --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as was the old suspicious sage,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the majestic, antlered royal,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; always contented with his life,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and with his dinner, and his wife.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {40}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (XIII, XIV,) XV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some days he's still in bed, and drowses,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when little notes come on a tray.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What? Invitations? Yes, three houses
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have each asked him to a soiree:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a ball here, there a children's party;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where shall he go, my rogue, my hearty?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which one comes first? It's just the same
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to do them all is easy game.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile, attired for morning strolling
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; complete with broad-brimmed bolivar,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eugene attends the boulevard,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and there at large he goes patrolling
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; until Breguet's unsleeping chime
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; advises him of dinner-time.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Make way, make way,'' goes up the shout;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his collar in its beaver braiding
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; glitters with hoar-frost all about.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He's flown to Talon's,<a href="#fn_6_4"><sup>4</sup></a> calculating
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that there his friend Kaverin's<a href="#fn_6_5"><sup>5</sup></a> waiting;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he arrives -- the cork goes flying up,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wine of the Comet<a href="#fn_6_6"><sup>6</sup></a> fills the cup;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before him roast beef, red and gory,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and truffles, which have ever been
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; youth's choice, the flower of French cuisine:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and pate, Strasbourg's deathless glory,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sits with Limburg's vivacious cheese
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and <i>ananas,</i> the gold of trees.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {41}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More wine, he calls, to drench the flaming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fire of the cutlets' scalding fat,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when Breguet's chime is heard proclaiming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the new ballet he should be at.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He's off -- this ruthless legislator
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the footlights, this fickle traitor
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to all the most adored <i>actrices,</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this denizen of the <i>coulisses</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that world where every man's a critic
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who'll clap an <i>entrechat,</i> or scoff
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at Cleopatra, hiss her off,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; boo Phaedra out as paralytic,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; encore Moe;na,<a href="#fn_6_7"><sup>7</sup></a> -- and rejoice
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to know the audience hears his voice.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Enchanted land! There like a lampion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that king of the satiric scene,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fonvizin<a href="#fn_6_8"><sup>8</sup></a> sparkled, freedom's champion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the derivative Knyazhni;n:<a href="#fn_6_8"><sup>8</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there Ózerov<a href="#fn_6_8"><sup>8</sup></a> shared the unwilling
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tribute of tears, applause's shrilling,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with young Semyo;nova,<a href="#fn_6_9"><sup>9</sup></a> and there
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our friend Katenin<a href="#fn_6_8"><sup>8</sup></a> brought to bear
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; once more Corneille's majestic story;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there caustic Shakhovsko;y<a href="#fn_6_8"><sup>8</sup></a> came in
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with comedies of swarm and din;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there Didelot<a href="#fn_6_10"><sup>10</sup></a> crowned himself with glory:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there, where the <i>coulisse</i> entrance went,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that's where my years of youth were spent.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {42}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My goddesses! Where are you banished?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lend ears to my lugubrious tone:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have other maidens, since you vanished,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; taken your place, though not your throne?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your chorus, is it dead for ever?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Russia's Terpsichore, shall never
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; again I see your soulful flight?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shall my sad gaze no more alight
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on features known, but to that dreary,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that alien scene must I now turn
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my disillusioned glass, and yearn,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bored with hilarity, and weary,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and yawn in silence at the stage
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as I recall a bygone age?
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The house is packed out; scintillating,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the gallery claps -- it's bored with waiting --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and up the rustling curtain crawls.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then with a half-ethereal splendour,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bound where the magic bow will send her,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Isto;mina,<a href="#fn_6_11"><sup>11</sup></a> thronged all around
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by Naiads, one foot on the ground,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; twirls the other slowly as she pleases,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then suddenly she's off, and there
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she's up and flying through the air
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like fluff before Aeolian breezes;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she'll spin this way and that, and beat
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; against each other swift, small feet.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {43}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Applause. Onegin enters -- passes
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; across the public's toes; he steers
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; straight to his stall, then turns his glasses
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on unknown ladies in the tiers;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he's viewed the boxes without passion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he's seen it all; with looks and fashion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he's dreadfully dissatisfied;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to gentlemen on every side
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he's bowed politely; his attention
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wanders in a distracted way
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; across the stage; he yawns: ``Ballet --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they all have richly earned a pension;''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he turns away: ``I've had enough --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now even Didelot's tedious stuff.''
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on stage are thumping without cease;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the footmen sleep on the <i>pelisses;</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the audience still is busy stamping,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; still coughing, hissing, clapping, champing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; still everywhere the lamps are bright;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; outside and in they star the night;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; still shivering in the bitter weather
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the horses fidget worse and worse;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the coachmen ring the fire, and curse
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their lords, and thwack their palms together;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but Eugene's out from din and press:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by now he's driving home to dress.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {44}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall I depict with expert knowledge
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the cabinet behind the door
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where the prize-boy of fashion's college
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is dressed, undressed, and dressed once more?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever for caprice of spending
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ingenious London has been sending
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; across the Baltic in exchange
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for wood and tallow; all the range
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of useful objects that the curious
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Parisian taste invents for one --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for friends of languor, or of fun,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or for the modishly luxurious --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all this, at eighteen years of age,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; adorned the sanctum of our sage.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Porcelain and bronzes on the table,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with amber pipes from Tsaregrad;<a href="#fn_6_12"><sup>12</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; such crystalled scents as best are able
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to drive the swooning senses mad;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with combs, and steel utensils serving
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as files, and scissors straight and curving,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; brushes on thirty different scales;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; brushes for teeth, brushes for nails.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rousseau (forgive a short distraction)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; could not conceive how solemn Grimm<a href="#fn_6_13"><sup>13</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dared clean his nails in front of <i>him,</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the brilliant crackpot: this reaction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shows freedom's advocate, that strong
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; champion of rights, as in the wrong.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {45}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A man who's active and incisive
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can yet keep nail-care much in mind:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; why fight what's known to be decisive?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; custom is despot of mankind.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dressed like -- --,<a href="#fn_6_14"><sup>14</sup></a> duly dreading
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the barbs that envy's always spreading,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eugene's a pedant in his dress,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in fact a thorough fop, no less.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three whole hours, at the least accounting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he'll spend before the looking-glass,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then from his cabinet he'll pass
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; giddy as Venus when she's mounting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a masculine disguise to aid
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her progress at the masquerade.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your curiosity is burning
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to hear what latest modes require,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and so, before the world of learning,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I could describe here his attire;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and though to do so would be daring,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it's my profession; he was wearing --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but <i>pantaloons, waistcoat,</i> and <i>frock,</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; these words are not of Russian stock:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know (and seek your exculpation)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that even so my wretched style
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; already tends too much to smile
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on words of foreign derivation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; though years ago I used to look
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at the Academic Diction-book.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {46}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That isn't our immediate worry:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we'd better hasten to the ball,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where, in a cab, and furious hurry,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin has outrun us all.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Along the fronts of darkened houses,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; along the street where slumber drowses,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; twin lamps of serried coupes throw
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a cheerful glimmer on the snow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and radiate a rainbow: blazing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with lampions studded all about
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the sumptuous palais shines out;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shadows that flit behind the glazing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; project in silhouette the tops
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of ladies and of freakish fops.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Up to the porch our hero's driven:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in, past concierge, up marble stair
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; flown like an arrow, then he's given
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a deft arrangement to his hair,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and entered. Ballroom overflowing...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and band already tired of blowing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while a mazurka holds the crowd;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and everything is cramped and loud;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; spurs of Chevalier Gardes are clinking,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dear ladies' feet fly past like hail,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and on their captivating trail
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; incendiary looks are slinking,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while roar of violins contrives
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to drown the hiss of modish wives.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {47}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In days of carefree aspirations,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the ballroom drove me off my head:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the safest place for declarations,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and where most surely notes are sped.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You husbands, deeply I respect you!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm at your service to protect you;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now pay attention, I beseech,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and take due warning from my speech.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You too, mamas, I pray attend it,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and watch your daughters closer yet,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yes, focus on them your lorgnette,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or else... or else, may God forfend it!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I only write like this, you know,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; since I stopped sinning years ago.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, on pleasure's wild variety
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I've wasted too much life away!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, did they not corrupt society,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'd still like dances to this day:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the atmosphere of youth and madness,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the crush, the glitter and the gladness,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the ladies' calculated dress;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I love their feet -- though I confess
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that all of Russia can't contribute
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; three pairs of handsome ones -- yet there
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exists for me one special pair!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one pair! I pay them memory's tribute
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; though cold I am and sad; in sleep
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the heartache that they bring lies deep.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {48}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, when, and to what desert banished,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; madman, can you forget their print?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my little feet, where have you vanished,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what flowers of spring display your dint?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nursed in the orient's languid weakness,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; across our snows of northern bleakness
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you left no steps that could be tracked:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you loved the opulent contact
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of rugs, and carpets' rich refinement.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was it for you that I became
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; long since unstirred by praise and fame
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and fatherland and grim confinement?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The happiness of youth is dead,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just like, on turf, your fleeting tread.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Diana's breast, the cheeks of Flora,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all these are charming! but to put
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it frankly, I'm a firm adorer
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the Terpsichorean foot.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It fascinates by its assurance
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of recompense beyond endurance,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and fastens, like a term of art,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the wilful fancies of the heart.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My love for it is just as tender,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; under the table's linen shield,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on springtime grasses of the field,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in winter, on the cast-iron fender,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on ballroom's looking-glass parquet
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or on the granite of the bay.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {49}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the seashore, with storm impending,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how envious was I of the waves
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each in tumultuous turn descending
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to lie down at her feet like slaves!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I longed, like every breaker hissing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to smother her dear feet with kissing.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No, never in the hottest fire
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of boiling youth did I desire
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with any torture so exquisite
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to kiss Armida's lips, or seek
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the flaming roses of a cheek,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or languid bosoms; and no visit
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of raging passion's surge and roll
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ever so roughly rocked my soul!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another page of recollection:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sometimes, in reverie's sacred land,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I grasp a stirrup with affection,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I feel a small foot in my hand;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fancies once more are hotly bubbling,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; once more that touch is fiercely troubling
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the blood within my withered heart,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; once more the love, once more the smart...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, now I've praised the queens of fashion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; enough of my loquacious lyre:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they don't deserve what they inspire
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in terms of poetry or passion --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their looks and language in deceit
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are just as nimble as their feet.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {50}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Eugene? half-awake, half-drowsing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from ball to bed behold him come;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while Petersburg's already rousing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; untirable, at sound of drum:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the merchant's up, the cabman's walking
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; towards his stall, the pedlar's hawking;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; see with their jugs the milk-girls go
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and crisply crunch the morning snow.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The city's early sounds awake her;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shutters are opened and the soft
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; blue smoke of chimneys goes aloft,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and more than once the German baker,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; punctilious in his cotton cap,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has opened up his serving-trap.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exhausted by the ballroom's clamour,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; converting morning to midnight,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he sleeps, away from glare and glamour,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this child of luxury and delight.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then, after midday he'll be waking;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his life till dawn's already making,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; always monotonously gay,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tomorrow just like yesterday.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But was it happy, his employment,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his freedom, in his youth's first flower,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with brilliant conquests by the shower,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and every day its own enjoyment?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was it to no effect that he,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at feasts, was strong and fancy-free?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {51}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No, early on his heart was cooling
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and he was bored with social noise;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no, not for long were belles the ruling
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; objective of his thoughts and joys:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; soon, infidelity proved cloying,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and friends and friendship, soul-destroying;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not every day could he wash down
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his beefsteak with champagne, or drown
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his Strasbourg pie, or point a moral,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; full of his usual pith and wit,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with cranium aching fit to split;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and though he liked a fiery quarrel --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet he fell out of love at last
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with sabre's slash, and bullet's blast.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The illness with which he'd been smitten
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; should have been analysed when caught,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; something like <i>spleen,</i> that scourge of Britain,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or Russia's <i>chondria,</i> for short;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it mastered him in slow gradation;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thank God, he had no inclination
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to blow his brains out, but in stead
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to life grew colder than the dead.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So, like Childe Harold, glum, unpleasing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he stalked the drawing-rooms, remote
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from Boston's cloth or gossip's quote;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no glance so sweet, no sigh so teasing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no, nothing caused his heart to stir,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and nothing pierced his senses' blur.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {52}
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Capricious belles of grand Society!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you were the first ones he forswore;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for in our time, beyond dubiety,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the highest circles are a bore.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's true, I'll not misrepresent them,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; some ladies preach from Say and Bentham,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but by and large their talk's a hash
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the most harmless, hopeless trash.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And what's more, they're so supercilious,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so pure, so spotless through and through,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so pious, and so clever too,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so circumspect, and so punctilious,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so virtuous that, no sooner seen,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at once they give a man the spleen.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You too, prime beauties in your flower
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who late at night are whirled away
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by drozhkies jaunting at full power
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; over the Petersburg <i>pave</i> --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he ended even your employment;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in retreat from all enjoyment
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; locked himself up inside his den
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and with a yawn took up his pen,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and tried to write, but a hard session
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of work made him feel sick, and still
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no word came flowing from his quill;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he failed to join that sharp profession
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which I myself won't praise or blame
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; since I'm a member of the same.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {53}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Idle again by dedication,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; oppressed by emptiness of soul,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he strove to achieve the appropriation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of other's thought -- a splendid goal;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with shelves of books deployed for action,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he read, and read -- no satisfaction:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; here's boredom, madness or pretence,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; here there's no conscience, here no sense;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they're all chained up in different fetters,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the ancients have gone stiff and cold,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the moderns rage against the old.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He'd given up girls -- now gave up letters,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and hid the bookshelf's dusty stack
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in taffeta of mourning black.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Escaped from social rhyme and reason,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; retired, as he, from fashion's stream,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was Onegin's friend that season.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I liked his quality, the dream
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which held him silently subjected,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his strangeness, wholly unaffected,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his mind, so cold and so precise.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The bitterness was mine -- the ice
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was his; we'd both drunk passion's chalice:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our lives were flat, and what had fired
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; both hearts to blaze had now expired;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there waited for us both the malice
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of blind Fortuna and of men
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in lives that were just dawning then.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {54}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He who has lived and thought is certain
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to scorn the men with whom he deals;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; days that are lost behind the curtain,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ghostlike, must trouble him who feels --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for him all sham has found rejection,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he's gnawed by serpent Recollection,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and by Repentance. All this lends,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on most occasions between friends,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a great attraction to conversing.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At first Onegin's tongue produced
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a haze in me, but I grew used
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to his disputing and his cursing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his virulence that made you smile,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his epigrams topped up with bile.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How often, when the sky was glowing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by Neva, on a summer night,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and when its waters were not showing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in their gay glass, the borrowed light
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of Dian's visage, in our fancies
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; recalling earlier time's romances,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; recalling earlier loves, did we,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now sensitive, and now carefree,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; drink in the midnight benediction,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the silence when our talk had ceased!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like convicts in a dream released
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from gaol to greenwood, by such fiction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we were swept off, in reverie's haze,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the beginning of our days.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {55}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Evgeny stood, with soul regretful,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and leant upon the granite shelf;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he stood there, pensive and forgetful,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just as the Poet<a href="#fn_6_15"><sup>15</sup></a> paints himself.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Silence was everywhere enthralling;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just sentries to each other calling,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and then a drozhky's clopping sound
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from Million Street<a href="#fn_6_16"><sup>16</sup></a> came floating round;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and then a boat, with oars a-swinging,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; swam on the river's dreaming face,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and then, with an enchanting grace,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; came distant horns, and gallant singing.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet sweeter far, at such a time,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the strain of Tasso's octave-rhyme!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O Adrian waves, my invocation;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O Brenta, I'll see you in dream;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hear, once more filled with inspiration,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the magic voices of your stream,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sacred to children of Apollo!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Proud Albion's lyre is what I follow,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; through it they're known to me, and kin.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Italian nights, when I'll drink in
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your molten gold, your charmed infusion;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with a Venetian maiden who
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can chatter, and be silent too,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'll float in gondola's seclusion;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from her my lips will learn and mark
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the tongue of love and of Petrarch.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {56}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; L
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When comes my moment to untether?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``it's time!'' and freedom hears my hail.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I walk the shore,<a href="#fn_6_17"><sup>17</sup></a> I watch the weather,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I signal to each passing sail.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beneath storm's vestment, on the seaway,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; battling along that watery freeway,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when shall I start on my escape?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's time to drop astern the shape
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the dull shores of my disfavour,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and there, beneath your noonday sky,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my Africa,<a href="#fn_6_18"><sup>18</sup></a> where waves break high,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to mourn for Russia's gloomy savour,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; land where I learned to love and weep,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; land where my heart is buried deep.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eugene would willingly have started
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with me to see an alien strand;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but soon the ways we trod were parted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for quite a while by fortune's hand.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His father died; and (as expected)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before Onegin there collected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the usurers' voracious tribe.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To private tastes we each subscribe:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Evgeny, hating litigation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and satisfied with what he'd got,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; made over to them his whole lot,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; finding in that no deprivation --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or else, from far off, he could see
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; old Uncle's end was soon to be.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {57}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In fact one day a note came flying
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from the agent, with this tale to tell:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Uncle, in bed, and near to dying,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wished him to come and say farewell.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Evgeny read the sad epistle
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and set off prompter than a whistle
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as fast as post-horses could go,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; already yawned before the show,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exercised, under lucre's banner,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in sighs and boredom and deceits
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (my tale's beginning here repeats);
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but, when he'd rushed to Uncle's manor,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a corpse on boards was all he found,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an offering ready for the ground.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The yard was bursting with dependants;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there gathered at the coffin-side
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; friends, foes, priests, guests, inured attendants
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of every funeral far and wide;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they buried Uncle, congregated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to eat and drink, then separated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with grave goodbyes to the bereaved,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as if some goal had been achieved.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eugene turned countryman. He tasted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the total ownership of woods,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mills, lands and waters -- he whose goods
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; till then had been dispersed and wasted --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and glad he was he'd thus arranged
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for his old courses to be changed.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {58}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It all seemed new -- for two days only --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the coolness of the sombre glade,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the expanse of fields, so wide, so lonely,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the murmur where the streamlet played...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the third day, wood and hill and grazing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gripped him no more; soon they were raising
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an urge to sleep; soon, clear as clear,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he saw that, as in cities, here
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; boredom has just as sure an entry,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; although there are no streets, no cards,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no mansions, no ballrooms, no bards.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, spleen was waiting like a sentry,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and dutifully shared his life
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just like a shadow, or a wife.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No, <i>I</i> was born for peace abounding
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and country stillness: there the lyre
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has voices that are more resounding,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; poetic dreams, a brighter fire.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To harmless idleness devoted,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on waves of <i>far niente</i> floated,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I roam by the secluded lake.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every morning I awake
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to freedom, softness and enjoyment:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sleep much, read little, and put down
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the thought of volatile renown.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was it not in such sweet employment
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; such shadowy and leisured ways,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that once I spent my happiest days?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {59}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O flowers, and love, and rustic leisure,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; o fields -- to you I'm vowed at heart.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I regularly take much pleasure
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in showing how to tell apart
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; myself and Eugene, lest a reader
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of mocking turn, or else a breeder
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of calculated slander should,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; spying my features, as he could,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; put back the libel on the table
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that, like proud Byron, I can draw
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self-portraits only -- furthermore
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the charge that poets are unable
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to sing of others must imply
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the poet's only theme is ``I.''
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poets, I'll say in this connection,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; adore the love that comes in dream.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In time past, objects of affection
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; peopled my sleep, and to their theme
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my soul in secret gave survival;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then from the Muse there came revival:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my carefree song would thus reveal
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the mountain maiden,<a href="#fn_6_19"><sup>19</sup></a> my ideal,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and captive girls, by Salgir<a href="#fn_6_20"><sup>20</sup></a> lying.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And now, my friends, I hear from you
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a frequent question: ``tell me who
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inspires your lute to sounds of sighing?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To whom do you, from all the train
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of jealous girls, devote its strain?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {60}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Whose glance, provoking inspiration,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rewards the music of your mind
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with fond caress? whose adoration
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is in your poetry enshrined?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No one's, I swear by God! in sadness
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I suffered once from all the madness
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of love's anxiety. Blessed is he
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who can combine it with the free
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fever of rhyme: thereby he's doubled
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; poetry's sacred frenzy, made
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a stride on Petrarch's path, allayed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the pangs with which his heart was troubled,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and, with it, forced renown to come --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but I, in love, was dull and dumb.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Love passed, the Muse appeared, the weather
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of mind got clarity new-found;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now free, I once more weave together
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; emotion, thought, and magic sound;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I write, my heart has ceased its pining,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my thoughtless pen has stopped designing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beside unfinished lines, a suite
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of ladies' heads, and ladies' feet;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dead ash sets no more sparks a-flying;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm grieving still, but no more tears,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and soon, oh soon the storm's arrears
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will in my soul be hushed and dying.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>That's</i> when I'll sit down to compose
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an ode in twenty-five cantos.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {61}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I've drawn a plan and a projection,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the hero's name's decided too.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile my novel's opening section
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is finished, and I've looked it through
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; meticulously; in my fiction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there's far too much of contradiction,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but I refuse to chop or change.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The censor's tribute, I'll arrange:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'll feed the journalists for dinner
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fruits of my labour and my ink...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So now be off to Neva's brink,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you newborn work, and like a winner
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; earn for me the rewards of fame --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; misunderstanding, noise, and blame!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {62}
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The place where Eugene loathed his leisure
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was an enchanting country nook:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there any friend of harmless pleasure
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; would bless the form his fortune took.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The manor house, in deep seclusion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; screened by a hill from storm's intrusion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; looked on a river: far away
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before it was the golden play
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of light that flowering fields reflected:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; villages flickered far and near,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and cattle roamed the plain, and here
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a park, enormous and neglected,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; spread out its shadow all around --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the pensive Dryads' hiding-ground.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {63}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; II
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>chateau</i> was of a construction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; befitting such a noble pile:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it stood, defiant of destruction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in sensible old-fashioned style.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; High ceilings everywhere abounded;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the saloon, brocade-surrounded,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ancestral<a href="#fn_7_1"><sup>1</sup></a> portraits met the view
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and stoves with tiles of various hue.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All this has now gone out of fashion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I don't know why, but for my friend
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; interior decor in the end
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; excited not a hint of passion:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a modish taste, a dowdy touch --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; both set him yawning just as much.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; III
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The rustic sage, in that apartment,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; forty years long would criticise
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his housekeeper and her department
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; look through the pane, and squash the flies.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oak-floored, and simple as a stable:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; two cupboards, one divan, a table,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no trace of ink, no spots, no stains.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of the cupboards, one contains
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a book of household calculations,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the other, jugs of applejack,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fruit liqueurs and an Almanack
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for 1808: his obligations
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had left the squire no time to look
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at any other sort of book.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {64}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alone amid all his possessions,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to pass the time was Eugene's theme:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it led him, in these early sessions,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to institute a new regime.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thinker in a desert mission,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he changed the <i>corvee</i> of tradition
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; into a small quit-rent -- and got
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his serfs rejoicing at their lot.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, in a fearful huff, his thrifty
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; neighbour was sure, from this would flow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; consequences of hideous woe;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; another's grin was sly and shifty,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but all concurred that, truth to speak,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he was a menace, and a freak.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; V
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At first they called; but on perceiving
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; invariably, as time went on,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that from the backdoor he'd be leaving
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on a fast stallion from the Don,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; once on the highway he'd detected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the noise their rustic wheels projected --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they took offence at this, and broke
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; relations off, and never spoke.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``The man's a boor; his brain is missing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he's a freemason too; for him,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; red wine in tumblers to the brim --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but ladies' hands are not for kissing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it's <i>yes</i> or <i>no,</i> but never <i>sir.</i>''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The vote was passed without demur.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {65}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile another new landowner
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; came driving to his country seat,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and, in the district, this <i>persona</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; drew scrutiny no less complete --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vladimir Lensky, whose creator
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was Gottingen, his <i>alma mater,</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; good-looking, in the flower of age,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a poet, and a Kantian sage.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He'd brought back all the fruits of learning
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from German realms of mist and steam,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; freedom's enthusiastic dream,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a spirit strange, a spirit burning,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an eloquence of fevered strength,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and raven curls of shoulder-length.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was too young to have been blighted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by the cold world's corrupt finesse;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his soul still blossomed out, and lighted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at a friend's word, a girl's caress.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In heart's affairs, a sweet beginner,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he fed on hope's deceptive dinner;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the world's <i>eclat,</i> its thunder-roll,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; still captivated his young soul.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sweetened up with fancy's icing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the uncertainties within his heart;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for him, the objective on life's chart
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was still mysterious and enticing --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; something to rack his brains about,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; suspecting wonders would come out.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {66}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was convinced, a kindred creature
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; would be allied to him by fate;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that, meanwhile, pinched and glum of feature,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from day to day she could but wait;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and he believed his friends were ready
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to put on chains for him, and steady
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their hand to grapple slander's cup,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in his defence, and smash it up;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; that there existed, for the indulgence
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of human friendship, holy men,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; immortals picked by fate for when,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with irresistible refulgence,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their breed would (some years after this)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shine out and bring the world to bliss. &gt;<a href="#fn_7_2"><sup>2</sup></a>
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Compassion, yes, and indignation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; honest devotion to the good,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bitter-sweet glory's inspiration,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; already stirred him as they should.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He roamed the world, his lyre behind him;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Schiller and Goethe had refined him,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and theirs was the poetic flame
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that fired his soul, to burn the same;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Muses' lofty arts and fashions,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fortunate one, he'd not disgrace;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but in his songs kept pride of place
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the sublime, and for the passions
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of virgin fancy, and again
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the charm of what was grave and plain.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {67}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; X
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sang of love, to love subjected,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his song was limpid in its tune
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as infant sleep, or the unaffected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thoughts of a girl, or as the moon
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; through heaven's expanse serenely flying,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that queen of secrets and of sighing.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sang of grief and parting-time,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of something vague, some misty clime;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; roses romantically blowing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of many distant lands he sang
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where in the heart of silence rang
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his sobs, where his live tears were flowing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he sang of lifetime's yellowed page --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when not quite eighteen years of age.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But in that desert his attainments
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; only to Eugene showed their worth;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lensky disliked the entertainments
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of neighbouring owners of the earth --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he fled from their resounding chatter!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their talk, so sound on every matter,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on liquor, and on hay brought in,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on kennels, and on kith and kin,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it had no sparkle of sensation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it lacked, of course, poetic heart,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sharpness of wit, and social art,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and logic; yet the conversation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; upon the side of the distaff --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that was less clever still by half.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {68}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vladimir, wealthy and good-looking,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was asked around as quite a catch --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; such is the usual country cooking;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and all the neighbours planned a match
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; between their girls and this <i>half-Russian.</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As soon as he appears, discussion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; touches obliquely, but with speed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on the dull life that bachelors lead;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and then it's tea that comes to mention,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and Dunya works the samovar;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and soon they bring her... a guitar
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and whisper ``Dunya, pay attention!''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then, help me God, she caterwauls:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Come to me in my golden halls.''
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lensky of course was quite untainted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by any itch for marriage ties;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; instead the chance to get acquainted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with Eugene proved a tempting prize.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So, verse and prose, they came together.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No ice and flame, no stormy weather
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and granite, were so far apart.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At first, disparity of heart
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rendered them tedious to each other;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then liking grew, then every day
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they met on horseback; quickly they
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; became like brother knit to brother.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Friendship, as I must own to you,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; blooms when there's nothing else to do.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {69}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But friendship, as between our heroes,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can't really be: for we've outgrown
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; old prejudice; all men are zeros,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the units are ourselves alone.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Napoleon's our sole inspiration;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the millions of two-legged creation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for us are instruments and tools;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; feeling is quaint, and fit for fools.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More tolerant in his conception
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than most. Evgeny, though he knew
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and scorned his fellows through and through,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet, as each rule has its exception,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; people there were he glorified,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; feelings he valued -- from outside.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He smiled as Lensky talked: the heady
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; perfervid language of the bard,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his mind, in judgement still unsteady,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and always the inspired regard --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to Eugene all was new and thrilling;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he struggled to bite back the chilling
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; word on his lips, and thought: it's sheer
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; folly for me to interfere
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with such a blissful, brief infection --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; even without me it will sink;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but meanwhile let him live, and think
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the universe is all perfection;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; youth is a fever; we must spare
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its natural right to rave and flare.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {70}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between them, every topic started
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reflection or provoked dispute:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; treaties of nations long departed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and good and ill, and learning's fruit,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the prejudices of the ages,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the secrets of the grave, the pages
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of fate, and life, each in its turn
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; became their scrutiny's concern.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the white heat of some dissension
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the abstracted poet would bring forth
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fragments of poems from the North,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which, listening with some condescension,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the tolerant Evgeny heard --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but scarcely understood a word.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But it was passion that preempted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the thoughts of my two anchorites.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From that rough spell at last exempted,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin spoke about its flights
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with sighs unconsciously regretful.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Happy is he who's known its fretful
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; empire, and fled it; happier still
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is he who's never felt its will,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he who has cooled down love with parting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and hate with malice; he whose life
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is yawned away with friends and wife
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; untouched by envy's bitter smarting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who on a deuce, that famous cheat,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has never staked his family seat.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {71}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When we've retreated to the banner
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of calm and reason, when the flame
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of passion's out, and its whole manner
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; become a joke to us, its game,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its wayward tricks, its violent surging,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its echoes, its belated urging,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reduced to sense, not without pain --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we sometimes like to hear again
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; passion's rough language talked by others,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and feel once more emotion's ban.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So a disabled soldier-man,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; retired, forgotten by his brothers,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in his small shack, will listen well
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to tales that young moustachios tell.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But it's the talent for concealing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that ardent youth entirely lacks;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hate, love, joy, sorrow -- every feeling,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it blabs, and spills them in its tracks.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As, lovingly, in his confession,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the poet's heart found full expression,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eugene, with solemn face, paid heed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and felt himself love's <i>invalide.</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lensky ingenuously related
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his conscience's record, and so
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin swiftly came to know
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his tale of youthful love, narrated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with deep emotion through and through,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to us, though, not exactly new.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {72}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ah, he had loved a love that never
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is known today; only a soul
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that raves with poetry can ever
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be doomed to feel it: there's one goal
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; perpetually, one goal for dreaming,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one customary object gleaming,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one customary grief each hour!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not separation's chilling power,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no years of absence past returning,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no beauties of a foreign clime,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no noise of gaiety, no time
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; devoted to the Muse, or learning,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nothing could alter or could tire
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this soul that glowed with virgin fire.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since earliest boyhood he had doted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on Olga; from heart's ache still spared,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with tenderness he'd watched and noted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her girlhood games; in them he'd shared,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by deep and shady woods protected;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the crown of marriage was projected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for them by fathers who, as friends
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and neighbours, followed the same ends.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Away inside that unassuming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; homestead, before her parents' gaze,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she blossomed in the graceful ways
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of innocence: a lily blooming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in deepest grasses, quite alone,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to bee and butterfly unknown.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {73}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And our young poet -- Olga fired him
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in his first dream of passion's fruit,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and thoughts of her were what inspired him
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the first meanings of his flute.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Farewell the games of golden childhood!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he fell in love with darkest wildwood,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; solitude, stillness and the night,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the stars, the moon -- celestial light
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to which so oft we've dedicated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; those walks amid the gloom and calm
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of evening, and those tears, the balm
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of secret pain... but it's now rated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by judgement of the modern camp
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; almost as good as a dim lamp.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full of obedience and demureness,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as gay as morning and as clear,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; poetic in her simple pureness,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sweet as a lover's kiss, and dear,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in Olga everything expresses --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the skyblue eyes, the flaxen tresses,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; smile, voice and movements, little waist --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; take any novel, clearly traced
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you're sure to find her portrait in it:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a portrait with a charming touch;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; once I too liked it very much;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but now it bores me every minute.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reader, the elder sister now
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; must be my theme, if you'll allow.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {74}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana<a href="#fn_7_3"><sup>3</sup></a> was her name... I own it,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self-willed it may be just the same;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but it's the first time you'll have known it,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a novel graced with such a name.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What of it? it's euphonious, pleasant,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and yet inseparably present,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know it, in the thoughts of all
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are old times, and the servants' hall.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We must confess that taste deserts us
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; even in our names (and how much worse
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when we begin to talk of verse);
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; culture, so far from healing, hurts us;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what it's transported to our shore
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is mincing manners -- nothing more.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So she was called Tatyana. Truly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she lacked her sister's beauty, lacked
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the rosy bloom that glowed so newly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to catch the eye and to attract.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shy as a savage, silent, tearful,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wild as a forest deer, and fearful,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana had a changeling look
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in her own home. She never took
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to kissing or caressing father
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or mother; and in all the play
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of children, though as young as they,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she never joined, or skipped, but rather
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in silence all day she'd remain
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ensconced beside the window-pane.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {75}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reflection was her friend and pleasure
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; right from the cradle of her days;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it touched with reverie her leisure,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; adorning all its country ways.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her tender touch had never fingered
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the needle, never had she lingered
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to liven with a silk <i>atour</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the linen stretched on the tambour.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sign of the urge for domination:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in play with her obedient doll
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the child prepares for protocol --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that corps of social legislation --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and to it, with a grave import,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; repeats what her mama has taught.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana had no dolls to dandle,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not even in her earliest age;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she'd never tell them news or scandal
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or novelties from fashion's page.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana never knew the attraction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of childish pranks: a chilled reaction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to horror-stories told at night
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in winter was her heart's delight.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whenever <i>nyanya</i> had collected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for Olga, on the spreading lawn,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her little friends, Tatyana'd yawn,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she'd never join the game selected,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for she was bored by laughs and noise
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and by the sound of silly joys.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {76}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She loved the balcony, the session
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of waiting for the dawn to blush,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when, in pale sky, the stars' procession
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fades from the view, and in the hush
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; earth's rim grows light, and a forewarning
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whisper of breeze announces morning,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and slowly day begins to climb.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In winter, when for longer time
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the shades of night within their keeping
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hold half the world still unreleased,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and when, by misty moon, the east
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is softly, indolently sleeping,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wakened at the same hour of night
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana'd rise by candlelight.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From early on she loved romances,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they were her only food... and so
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she fell in love with all the fancies
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of Richardson and of Rousseau.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her father, kindly, well-regarded,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but in an earlier age retarded,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; could see no harm in books; himself
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he never took one from the shelf,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thought them a pointless peccadillo;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and cared not what his daughter kept
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by way of secret tome that slept
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; until the dawn beneath her pillow.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His wife, just like Tatyana, had
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on Richardson gone raving mad.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {77}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And not because she'd read him, either,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and not because she'd once preferred
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lovelace, or Grandison, or neither;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but in the old days she had heard
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; about them -- nineteen to the dozen --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so often from her Moscow cousin
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Princess Alina. She was still
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; engaged then -- but against her will;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; loved someone else, not her intended,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; someone towards whose heart and mind
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her feelings were far more inclined --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this Grandison of hers was splendid,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a fop, a punter on the cards,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and junior Ensign in the Guards.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was like him and always sported
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the latest fashions of the town;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but, without asking, they transported
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her to the altar and the crown.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The better to dispel her sorrow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her clever husband on the morrow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; took her to his estate, where she,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at first, with God knows whom to see,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in tears and violent tossing vented
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her grief, and nearly ran away.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then, plunged in the housekeeper's day,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she grew accustomed, and contented.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In stead of happiness, say I,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; custom's bestowed us from on high.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {78}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it was custom that consoled her
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in grief that nothing else could mend;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; soon a great truth came to enfold her
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and give her comfort to the end:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she found, in labours and in leisure,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the secret of her husband's measure,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and ruled him like an autocrat --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so all went smoothly after that.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mushrooms in brine, for winter eating,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fieldwork directed from the path,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; accounts, shaved forelocks,<a href="#fn_7_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Sunday bath;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; meantime she'd give the maids a beating
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if her cross mood was at its worst --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but <i>never</i> asked her husband first.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No, soon she changed her old demeanour:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; girls' albums, signed in blood for choice;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Praskovya re-baptized ``Polina'';
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; conversing in a singsong voice;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lacing her stays up very tightly;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pronouncing through her nose politely
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Russian N, like N in French;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; soon all that went without a wrench:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; album and stays, Princess Alina,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sentiment, notebook, verses, all
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she quite forgot -- began to call
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Akulka'' the onetime Selina,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and introduced, for the last lap,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a quilted chamber-robe and cap.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {79}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her loving spouse with approbation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; left her to follow her own line,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; trusted her without hesitation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and wore his dressing-gown to dine.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His life went sailing in calm weather;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sometimes the evening brought together
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; neighbours and friends in kindly group,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a plain, unceremonious troop,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for grumbling, gossiping and swearing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and for a chuckle or a smile.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The evening passes, and meanwhile
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; here's tea that Olga's been preparing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; after that, supper's served, and so
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bed-time, and time for guests to go.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Throughout their life, so calm, so peaceful,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sweet old tradition was preserved:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for them, in Butterweek<a href="#fn_7_5"><sup>5</sup></a> the greaseful,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Russian pancakes were always served;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; ...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... &gt;<a href="#fn_7_2"><sup>2</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they needed kvas like air; at table
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their guests, for all they ate and drank,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; were served in order of their rank.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {80}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so they lived, two ageing mortals,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; till he at last was summoned down
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; into the tomb's wide open portals,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and once again received a crown.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just before dinner, from his labours
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he rested -- wept for by his neighbours,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his children and his faithful wife,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; far more than most who leave this life.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was a good and simple <i>barin;</i><a href="#fn_7_6"><sup>6</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; above the dust of his remains
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the funeral monument explains:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``A humble sinner, Dimitry Larin,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beneath the stone reposes here,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; servant of God, and Brigadier.''
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lensky, restored to his manorial
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; penates, came to cast an eye
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; over his neighbour's plain memorial,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and offer to that ash a sigh;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sadly he mourned for the departed.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Poor Yorick,'' said he, broken-hearted:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``he dandled me as a small boy.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How many times I made a toy
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of his Ocha;kov<a href="#fn_7_7"><sup>7</sup></a> decoration!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He destined Olga's hand for me,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; kept asking: "shall I live to see"...''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so, full of heart-felt tribulation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lensky composed in autograph
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a madrigal for epitaph.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {81}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There too, he honoured, hotly weeping,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his parents' patriarchal dust
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with lines to mark where they were sleeping...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! the generations must,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as fate's mysterious purpose burrows,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reap a brief harvest on their furrows;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they rise and ripen and fall dead:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; others will follow where they tread...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and thus our race, so fluctuating,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; grows, surges, boils, for lack of room
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; presses its forebears to the tomb.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We too shall find our hour is waiting;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it will be our descendants who
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; out of this world will crowd us too.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So glut yourselves until you're sated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on this unstable life, my friends!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its nullity I've always hated,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know too surely how it ends.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm blind to every apparition;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and yet a distant admonition
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of hope sometimes disturbs my heart;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it would be painful to depart
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and leave no faint footprint of glory...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I never lived or wrote for praise;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet how I wish that I might raise
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to high renown my doleful story,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that there be just one voice which came,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like a true friend, to speak my name.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {82}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XL
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And someone's heart will feel a quiver,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for maybe fortune will have saved
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from drowning's death in Lethe river
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the strophe over which I slaved;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; perhaps -- for flattering hope will linger --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; some future dunce will point a finger
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at my famed portrait and will say:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>he</i> was a poet in his day.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I thank him without reservation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the peaceful Muses' devotee,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whose memory will preserve for me
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the fleeting works of my creation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whose kindly hand will ruffle down
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the laurel in the old man's crown!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {83}
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``You're off? why, there's a poet for you!''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Goodbye, Onegin, time I went.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Well, I won't hold you up or bore you;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but where are all your evenings spent?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``At the Larins'!'' ``But how mysterious.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For goodness' sake, you can't be serious
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; killing each evening off like that?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``You're wrong.'' ``But what I wonder at
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is this -- one sees from here the party:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in first place -- listen, am I right? --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a simple Russian family night:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the guests are feasted, good and hearty,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on jam, and speeches in regard
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to rains, and flax, and the stockyard.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {84}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; II
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``I don't see what's so bad about it.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Boredom, that's what so bad, my friend.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Your modish world, I'll do without it;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; give me the homely hearth, and lend...''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``You pile one eclogue on another!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for God's sake, that will do. But, brother,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you're really going? Well, I'm sad.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, Lensky, would it be so bad
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for me to glimpse this Phyllis ever
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with whom your thoughts are so obsessed --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pen, tears, and rhymes, and all the rest?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Present me, please.'' ``You're joking.'' ``Never.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Gladly.'' ``So when?'' ``Why not tonight?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They will receive us with delight.''
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; III
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Let's go.'' The friends, all haste and vigour,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; drive there, and with formality
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are treated to the fullest rigour
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of old-lime hospitality.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The protocol is all one wishes:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the jams appear in little dishes;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on a small table's oilcloth sheen
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the jug of bilberry wine is seen.<a href="#fn_8_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {85}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And home was now their destination;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as by the shortest way they flew,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this was our heroes' conversation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; secretly overheard by you.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``You yawn, Onegin?'' ``As I'm used to.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``This time I think you've been reduced to
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; new depths of boredom.'' ``No, the same.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fields are dark, since evening came.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Drive on, Andryushka! quicker, quicker!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the country's pretty stupid here!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; oh, <i>a; propos:</i> Larin's a dear
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; simple old lady; but the liquor --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm much afraid that bilberry wine
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; won't benefit these guts of mine.''
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; V
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``But tell me, which one was Tatyana?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``She was the one who looked as still
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and melancholy as Svetlana,<a href="#fn_8_2"><sup>2</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and sat down by the window-sill.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``The one you love's the younger daughter?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Why not?'' ``I'd choose the other quarter
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if I, like you, had been a bard.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Olga's no life in her regard:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the roundest face that you've set eyes on,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a pretty girl exactly like
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; any Madonna by Van Dyck:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a dumb moon, on a dumb horizon.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lensky had a curt word to say
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and then sat silent all the way.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {86}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile the news of Eugene coming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the Larins' had caused a spout
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of gossip, and set comment humming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; among the neighbours round about.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Conjecture found unending matter:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there was a general furtive chatter,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and jokes and spiteful gossip ran
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; claiming Tatyana'd found her man;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and some were even testifying
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the marriage plans were all exact
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but held up by the simple fact
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that modish rings were still a-buying.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Lensky's fate they said no more --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they'd settled that some years before.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana listened with vexation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to all this tattle, yet at heart
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in indescribable elation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; despite herself, rehearsed the part:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the thought sank in, and penetrated:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she fell in love -- the hour was fated...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so fires of spring will bring to birth
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a seedling fallen in the earth.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her feelings in their weary session
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had long been wasting and enslaved
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by pain and languishment; she craved
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the fateful diet; by depression
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her heart had long been overrun:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her soul was waiting... for someone.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {87}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana now need wait no longer.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her eyes were opened, and she said
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``this is the one!'' Ah, ever stronger,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in sultry sleep, in lonely bed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all day, all night, his presence fills her,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by magic everything instils her
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with thoughts of him in ceaseless round.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She hates a friendly voice's sound,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or servants waiting on her pleasure.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sunk in dejection, she won't hear
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the talk of guests when they appear;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she calls down curses on their leisure,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and, when one's least prepared for it
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their tendency to call, and sit.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, she devours, with what attention,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; delicious novels, laps them up;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and all their ravishing invention
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with sheer enchantment fills her cup!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These figures from the world of seeming,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; embodied by the power of dreaming,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the lover of Julie Wolmar,<a href="#fn_8_3"><sup>3</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and Malek Adel,<a href="#fn_8_4"><sup>4</sup></a> de Linar,<a href="#fn_8_5"><sup>5</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and Werther, martyred and doom-laden,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and Grandison beyond compare,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who sets <i>me</i> snoring then and there --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all for our tender dreamy maiden
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are coloured in a single tone,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all blend into Eugene alone.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {88}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; X
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seeing herself as a creation --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Clarissa, Julie, or Delphine<a href="#fn_8_6"><sup>6</sup></a> --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by writers of her admiration,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana, lonely heroine,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; roamed the still forest like a ranger,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sought in her book, that text of danger
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and found her dreams, her secret fire,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the full fruit of her heart's desire;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she sighed, and in a trance coopted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; another's joy, another's breast,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whispered by heart a note addressed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the hero that she'd adopted.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But ours, whatever he might be,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ours was no Grandison -- not he.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lending his tone a grave inflection,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the ardent author of the past
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; showed one a pattern of perfection
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in which his hero's mould was cast.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He gave this figure -- loved with passion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wronged always in disgraceful fashion --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a soul of sympathy and grace,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and brains, and an attractive face.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Always our fervid hero tended
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pure passion's flame, and in a trice
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; would launch into self-sacrifice;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; always before the volume ended
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; due punishment was handed down
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to vice, while virtue got its crown.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {89}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today a mental fog enwraps us,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each moral puts us in a doze,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; even in novels, vice entraps us,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yes, even there its triumph grows.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now that the British Muse is able
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to wreck a maiden's sleep with fable,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the idol that she'll most admire
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is either the <i>distrait</i> Vampire,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Melmoth,<a href="#fn_8_7"><sup>7</sup></a> whose roaming never ceases,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sbogar,<a href="#fn_8_8"><sup>8</sup></a> mysterious through and through,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Corsair, or the Wandering Jew.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Byron, with his shrewd caprices,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dressed up a desperate egoism
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to look like sad romanticism.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this, dear reader, if you know it,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; show me the sense. Divine decree
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; may wind up my career as poet;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; perhaps, though Phoebus warns, I'll see
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; installed in me a different devil,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and sink to prose's humble level:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a novel on the established line
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; may then amuse my glad decline.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No secret crimes, and no perditions,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shall make my story grim as hell;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no, quite naively I'll retell
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a Russian family's old traditions;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; love's melting dreams shall fill my rhyme,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and manners of an earlier time.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {90}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'll catalogue each simple saying
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in father's or old uncle's book,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and tell of children's plighted playing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by ancient limes, or by a brook;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and after jealousy's grim weather
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'll part them, bring them back together;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'll make them spar another round,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then to the altar, to be crowned.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'll conjure up that swooning fashion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of ardent speech, that aching flow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of language which, so long ago,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; facing a belle I loved with passion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my tongue kept drawing from the heart --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but now I've rather lost the art.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana dear, with you I'm weeping:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for you have, at this early date,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; into a modish tyrant's keeping
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; resigned disposal of your fate.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dear Tanya, you're condemned to perish;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but first, the dreams that hope can cherish
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; evoke for you a sombre bliss;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you learn life's sweetness, and with this
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you drink the magic draught of yearning,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that poison brew; and in your mind
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reverie hounds you, and you find
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shelter for trysts at every turning;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in front of you, on every hand,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you see your fated tempter stand.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {91}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana, hunted by love's anguish,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has made the park her brooding-place,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; suddenly lowering eyes that languish,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; too faint to stir a further pace:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her bosom heaves, her cheeks are staring
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; scarlet with passion's instant flaring,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; upon her lips the breathing dies,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; noise in her ears, glare in her eyes...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then night comes on; the moon's patrolling
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; far-distant heaven's vaulted room;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a nightingale, in forest gloom,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sets a sonorous cadence rolling --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana, sleepless in the dark,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; makes to her nurse low-voiced remark:
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``I can't sleep, <i>nyanya:</i> it's so stifling!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; open the window, sit down near.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Why, Tanya, what...?'' ``All's dull and trifling.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The olden days, I want to hear...''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``What of them, Tanya? I was able,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; years back, to call up many a fable;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I kept in mind an ancient store
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of tales of girls, and ghosts, and lore:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but now my brain is darkened, Tanya:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now I've forgotten all I knew.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A sorry state of things, it's true!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My mind is fuddled.'' ``Tell me, <i>nyanya,</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your early life, unlock your tongue:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; were you in love when you were young?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {92}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``What nonsense, Tanya! in those other
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ages we'd never heard of love:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; why, at the thought, my husband's mother
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had chased me to the world above.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``How did you come to marry, <i>nyanya?</i>''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``I reckon, by God's will. My Vanya
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was younger still, but at that stage
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was just thirteen years of age.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two weeks the matchmaker was plying
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to see my kin, and in the end
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my father blessed me. So I'd spend
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my hours in fear and bitter crying.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then, crying, they untwined my plait,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and sang me to the altar-mat.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``So to strange kinsfolk I was taken...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but you're not paying any heed.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Oh nurse, I'm sad, I'm sad, I'm shaken,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm sick, my dear, I'm sick indeed.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm near to sobbing, near to weeping!...''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``You're ill, God have you in his keeping,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Lord have mercy on us all!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whatever you may need, just call...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'll sprinkle you with holy water,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you're all in fever... heavens above.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Nurse, I'm not ill; I... I'm in love.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``The Lord God be with you, my daughter!''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and, hands a-tremble, <i>Nyanya</i> prayed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and put a cross-sign on the maid.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {93}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``I am in love,'' Tatyana's wailing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whisper repeated to the crone.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``My dearest heart, you're sick and ailing.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``I am in love; leave me alone.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all the while the moon was shining
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and with its feeble glow outlining
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the girl's pale charms, her loosened hair,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her drops of tears, and seated there,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in quilted coat, where rays were gleaming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on a small bench by Tanya's bed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the grey-haired nurse with kerchiefed head;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and everything around was dreaming,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the deep stillness of the night,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bathed in the moon's inspiring light.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana watched the moon, and floated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; through distant regions of the heart...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thought was born, and quickly noted...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Go, nurse, and leave me here apart.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Give me a pen and give me paper,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bring up a table, and a taper;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; good night; I swear I'll lie down soon.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was alone, lit by the moon.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Elbow on table, spirit seething,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; still filled with Eugene, Tanya wrote,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in her unconsidered note
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all a pure maiden's love was breathing.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She folds the page, lays down the plume.,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana! it's addressed... to whom?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {94}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I've known too many a haughty beauty,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cold, pure as ice, and as unkind,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inexorably wed to duty,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unfathomable to the mind;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shocked by their modish pride, and fleeing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the utter virtue of their being,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I've run a mile, I must avow,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; having decyphered on their brow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hell's terrifying imprecation:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Abandon hope for evermore.''<a href="#fn_8_9"><sup>9</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our love is what they most abhor;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our terror is their consolation.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ladies of such a cast, I think,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you too have seen on Neva's brink.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thronged by adorers, I've detected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; another, freakish one, who stays
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; quite self-absorbed and unaffected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by sighs of passion or by praise.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To my astonishment I've seen her,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; having by her severe demeanour
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; frightened to death a timid love,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; revive it with another shove --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at least by a regretful kindness;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at least her tone is sometimes found
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; more tender than it used to sound.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I've seen how, trustful in his blindness,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the youthful lover once again
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; runs after what is sweet, and vain.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {95}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why is Tatyana guiltier-seeming?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is it that she, poor simple sweet,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; believes in her elected dreaming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and has no knowledge of deceit?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that, artless, and without concealing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her love obeys the laws of feeling,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that she's so trustful, and imbued
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by heaven with such an unsubdued
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; imagination, with such reason,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; such stubborn brain, and vivid will,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and heart so tender, it can still
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; burst to a fiery blaze in season?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such feckless passion -- as I live,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is this then what you can't forgive?
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The flirt has reason's cool volition;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana's love is no by-play,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she yields to it without condition
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like a sweet child. She'll never say:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``By virtue of procrastinating
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we'll keep love's price appreciating,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we'll draw it deeper in our net;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; first, we'll take vanity, and let
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hope sting it, then we'll try deploying
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; doubts, to exhaust the heart, then fire
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jealousy's flame, to light desire;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; else, having found his pleasure cloying,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the cunning prisoner can quite well
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at any hour escape his cell.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {96}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I see another problem looming:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to save the honour of our land
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I <i>must</i> translate -- there's no presuming --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the letter from Tatyana's hand:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her Russian was as thin as vapour,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she never read a Russian paper,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our native speech had never sprung
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unhesitating from her tongue,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she wrote in French... what a confession!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what can one do? as said above,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; until this day, a lady's love
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in Russian never found expression,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; till now our language -- proud, God knows --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has hardly mastered postal prose.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They should be forced to read in Russian,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hear you say. But can you see
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a lady -- what a grim discussion! --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with <i>The Well-Meaner</i><a href="#fn_8_10"><sup>10</sup></a> on her knee?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I ask you, each and every poet!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the darling objects -- don't you know it? --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for whom, to expiate your crimes,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you've made so many secret rhymes,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to whom your hearts are dedicated,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is it not true that Russian speech,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so sketchily possessed by each,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by all is sweetly mutilated,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and it's the foreign phrase that trips
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like native idiom from their lips?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {97}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Protect me from such apparition
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on dance-floor, at breakup of ball,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as bonneted Academician
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or seminarist in yellow shawl!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To me, unsmiling lips bring terror,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; however scarlet; free from error
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of grammar, Russian language too.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, to my cost it may be true
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that generations of new beauties,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; heeding the press, will make us look
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; more closely at the grammar-book;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that verse will turn to useful duties;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on me, all this has no effect:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tradition still keeps my respect.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No, incorrect and careless chatter,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; words mispronounced, thoughts ill-expressed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; evoke emotion's pitter-patter,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now as before, inside my breast;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; too weak to change, I'm staying vicious,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I still find Gallicism delicious
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as youthful sinning, or the strains
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of Bogdano;vich's<a href="#fn_8_11"><sup>11</sup></a> refrains.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that's enough. My beauty's letter
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; must now employ my pen; somehow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I gave my word, alas, though now
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a blank default would suit me better.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I own it: tender Parny's<a href="#fn_8_12"><sup>12</sup></a> rhyme
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is out of fashion in our time.

<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bard<a href="#fn_8_13"><sup>13</sup></a> of <i>The Feasts,</i> and heart's depression,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if you'd still been with me, dear friend,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would have had the indiscretion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to ask of you that you transcend
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in music's own bewitching fashion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the foreign words a maiden's passion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; found for its utterance that night.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where are you? come -- and my own right
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with an obeisance I'll hand over...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he, by sad and rocky ways,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with heart that's grown unused to praise,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on Finland's coast a lonely rover --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he doesn't hear when I address
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his soul with murmurs of distress.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana's letter, treasured ever
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as sacred, lies before me still.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I read with secret pain, and never
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can read enough to get my fill.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who taught her an address so tender,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; such careless language of surrender?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who taught her all this mad, slapdash,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; heartfelt, imploring, touching trash
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fraught with enticement and disaster?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It baffles me. But I'll repeat
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; here a weak version, incomplete,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pale transcript of a vivid master,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or <i>Freischutz</i> as it might be played
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by nervous hands of a schoolmaid:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {99}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana's Letter to Onegin
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>``I write to you -- no more confession
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is needed, nothing's left to tell.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know it's now in your discretion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with scorn to make my world a hell.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``But, if you've kept some faint impression
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of pity for my wretched state,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you'll never leave me to my fate.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At first I thought it out of season
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to speak; believe me: of my shame
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you'd not so much as know the name,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if I'd possessed the slightest reason
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to hope that even once a week
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I might have seen you, heard you speak
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on visits to us, and in greeting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I might have said a word, and then
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thought, day and night, and thought again
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; about one thing, till our next meeting.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But you're not sociable, they say:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you find the country godforsaken;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; though we... don't shine in any way,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our joy in you is warmly taken.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Why did you visit us, but why?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lost in our backwoods habitation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'd not have known you, therefore I
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; would have been spared this laceration.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In time, who knows, the agitation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of inexperience would have passed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would have found a friend, another,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in the role of virtuous mother
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and faithful wife I'd have been cast.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {100}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Another!... No, another never
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in all the world could take my heart!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Decreed in highest court for ever...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; heaven's will -- for you I'm set apart;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and my whole life has been directed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and pledged to you, and firmly planned:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know, Godsent one, I'm protected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; until the grave by your strong hand:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you'd made appearance in my dreaming;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unseen, already you were dear,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my soul had heard your voice ring clear,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stirred at your gaze, so strange, so gleaming,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; long, long ago... no, that could be
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no dream. You'd scarce arrived, I reckoned
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to know you, swooned, and in a second
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all in a blaze, I said: it's he!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``You know, it's true, how I attended,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; drank in your words when all was still --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; helping the poor, or while I mended
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with balm of prayer my torn and rended
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; spirit that anguish had made ill.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At this midnight of my condition,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was it not you, dear apparition,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who in the dark came flashing through
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and, on my bed-head gently leaning,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with love and comfort in your meaning,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; spoke words of hope? But who are you:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the guardian angel of tradition,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or some vile agent of perdition
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sent to seduce? Resolve my doubt.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, this could all be false and vain,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a sham that trustful souls work out;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {101}
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fate could be something else again..,
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``So let it be! for you to keep
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I trust my fate to your direction,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; henceforth in front of you I weep,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I weep, and pray for your protection..,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Imagine it: quite on my own
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I've no one here who comprehends me,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and now a swooning mind attends me,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dumb I must perish, and alone.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My heart awaits you: you can turn it
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to life and hope with just a glance --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or else disturb my mournful trance
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with censure -- I've done all to earn it!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``I close. I dread to read this page...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for shame and fear my wits are sliding...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and yet your honour is my gage
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in it boldly I'm confiding''...</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {102}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now Tanya's groaning, now she's sighing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the letter trembles in her grip;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the rosy sealing-wafer's drying
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; upon her feverish tongue; the slip
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from off her charming shoulder's drooping,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and sideways her poor head is stooping.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now the radiance of the moon
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is dimmed. Down there the valley soon
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; comes clearer through the mists of dawning.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Down there, by slow degrees, the stream
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has taken on a silvery gleam;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the herdsman's horn proclaimed the morning
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and roused the village long ago:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to Tanya, all's an empty show.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She's paid the sunrise no attention,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she sits with head sunk on her breast,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; over the note holds in suspension
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her seal with its engraven crest.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Softly the door is opened, enter
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; grey Filatevna, to present her
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with a small tray and a teacup.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Get up, my child, it's time, get up!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why, pretty one, you're up already!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My early bird! you know, last night
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you gave me such a shocking fright!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but now, thank God, you're well and steady,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your night of fretting's left no trace!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fresh as a poppy-flower, your face.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {103}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Oh nurse, a favour, a petition...''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Command me, darling, as you choose.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Now don't suppose... let no suspicion...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but, nurse, you see... Oh, don't refuse...''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``My sweet, God warrants me your debtor.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Then send your grandson with this letter
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; quickly to O... I mean to that...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the neighbour... you must tell the brat
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that not a syllable be uttered
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and not a mention of my name...''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Which neighbour, dear? My head became
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in these last years all mixed and fluttered.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We've many neighbours round about;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; even to count them throws me out.''
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``How slow you are at guessing, <i>nyanya!</i>''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``My sweet, my dearest heart, I'm old,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm old, my mind is blunted, Tanya;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; times were when I was sharp and bold:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; times were, when master's least suggestion...''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Oh <i>nyanya, nyanya,</i> I don't question...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what have your wits to do with me?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now here's a letter, as you see,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; addressed to Onegin''... ...'Well, that's easy.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But don't be cross, my darling friend,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you know I'm <i>hard to comprehend...</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why have you gone all pale and queasy?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``It's nothing, nurse, nothing, I say...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just send your grandson on his way.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {104}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hours pass; no answer; waiting, waiting.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No word: another day goes by.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She's dressed since dawn, dead pale; debating,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; demanding: <i>when</i> will he reply?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Olga's adorer comes a-wooing.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Tell me, what's your companion doing?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; enquired the lady of the hall:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``it seems that he forgot us all.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana flushed, and started shaking.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Today he promised he'd be here,''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so Lensky answered the old dear:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``the mail explains the time he's taking.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana lowered her regard
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as at a censure that was hard.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Day faded; on the table, glowing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the samovar of evening boiled,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and warmed the Chinese teapot; flowing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beneath it, vapour wreathed and coiled.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Already Olga's hand was gripping
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the urn of perfumed tea, and tipping
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; into the cups its darkling stream --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; meanwhile a hallboy handed cream;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before the window taking station,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; plunged in reflection's deepest train,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana breathed on the cold pane,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in the misted condensation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with charming forefinger she traced
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``OE'' devotedly inlaced.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {105}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile with pain her soul was girdled,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and tears were drowning her regard.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A sudden clatter!... blood was curdled...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now nearer... hooves... and in the yard
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Evgeny! ``Ah!'' Tatyana, fleeting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; light as a shadow, shuns a meeting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; through the back porch runs out and flies
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; down to the garden, and her eyes
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; daren't look behind her; fairly dashing --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beds, bridges, lawn, she never stops,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the <i>allee</i> to the lake, the copse;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; breaking the lilac bushes, smashing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; parterres, she runs to rivulet's brink,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to gasp, and on a bench to sink.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She dropped... ``It's he! Eugene arriving!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh God, what did he think!'' A dream
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of hope is somehow still surviving
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in her torn heart -- a fickle gleam;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she trembles, and with fever drumming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; awaits him -- hears nobody coming.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maidservants on the beds just now
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; were picking berries from the bough,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; singing in chorus as directed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (on orders which of course presume
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that thievish mouths cannot consume
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their masters' berries undetected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so long as they're employed in song:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; such rustic cunning can't be wrong!) --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {106}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Song of the Girls
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>``Maidens, pretty maidens all,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dear companions, darling friends,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pretty maidens, romp away,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have your fill of revelry!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Strike the ditty up, my sweets,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ditty of our secret world,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and entice a fellow in
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the circle of our dance.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When we draw a fellow in,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when we see him from afar,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; darlings, then we'll run away,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cherries then we'll throw at him,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cherries throw and raspberries
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and redcurrants throw at him.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Never come and overhear
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ditties of our secret world,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; never come and like a spy
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; watch the games we maidens play.''</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {107}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XL
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They sing; unmoved by their sweet-sounding
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; choruses, Tanya can but wait,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; listless, impatient, for the pounding
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; within her bosom to abate,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and for her cheeks to cease their blushing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but wildly still her heart is rushing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and on her cheeks the fever stays,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; more and more brightly still they blaze.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So the poor butterfly will quiver
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and beat a nacreous wing when caught
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by some perverse schoolboy for sport;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and so in winter-fields will shiver
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the hare who from afar has seen
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a marksman crouching in the green.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But finally she heaved a yearning
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sigh, and stood up, began to pace;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she walked, but just as she was turning
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; into the <i>allee,</i> face to face,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she found Evgeny, eyes a-glitter,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; still as a shadow, grim and bitter;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; seared as by fire, she stopped. Today
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I lack the strength required to say
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what came from this unlooked-for meeting;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my friends, I need to pause a spell,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and walk, and breathe, before I tell
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a story that still wants completing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I need to rest from all this rhyme:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'll end my tale some other time.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {108}
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With womankind, the less we love them,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the easier they become to charm,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the tighter we can stretch above them
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; enticing nets to do them harm.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was a period when cold-blooded
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; debauchery was praised, and studied
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as love's technique, when it would blare
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its own perfection everywhere,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and heartless pleasure was up-graded;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yes, these were our forefathers' ways,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; those monkeys of the good old days:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now Lovelace's renown has faded
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as scarlet heels have lost their name
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and stately periwigs, their fame.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {109}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How dull are acting and evasion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; diversely urging the same plea,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; earnestly striving for persuasion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on points that all long since agree --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and always the self-same objection;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how dull to work for the correction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of prejudice that's never been
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; harboured by maidens of thirteen!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who's not disgusted by cajoling,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; threats, vows, and simulated fears,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by six-page letters, rings and tears,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gossip, and tricks, and the patrolling
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of aunts and mothers, and the thrall
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of husband's friendship -- worst of all!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Evgeny thought in just this fashion.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From his first youth he'd known the force,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the sufferings of tempestuous passion;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its winds had blown him far off course.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spoilt by the habit of indulgence,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now dazzled by one thing's effulgence,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now disenchanted with the next,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; more and more bored by yearning's text,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bored by success' giddy trifle,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he heard in stillness and in din
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a deathless murmur from within,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; found that in laughter yawns could stifle:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he killed eight years in such a style,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and wasted life's fine flower meanwhile.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {110}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; X
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though belles had lost his adoration,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he danced attendance with the best;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rebuffed, found instant consolation;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; deceived, was overjoyed to rest.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He followed them without illusion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lost them without regret's contusion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; scarcely recalled their love, their spite;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just like a casual guest who might
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; devote to whist an evening party,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who'd sit, and at the end of play
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; would say goodbye and drive away,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; go off to sleep quite hale and hearty,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in the morning wouldn't know
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that self-same evening where he'd go.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet Tanya's note made its impression
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on Eugene, he was deeply stirred:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that virgin dream and its confession
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; filled him with thoughts that swarmed and whirred;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the flower-like pallor of the maiden,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her look, so sweetly sorrow-laden,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all plunged his soul deep in the stream
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of a delicious, guiltless dream...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and though perhaps old fires were thrusting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and held him briefly in their sway,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eugene had no wish to betray
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a soul so innocent, so trusting.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to the garden, to the scene
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where Tanya now confronts Eugene.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {111}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moments of silence, quite unbroken;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then, stepping nearer, Eugene said:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``You wrote to me, and nothing spoken
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can disavow that. I have read
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; those words where love, without condition,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pours out its guiltless frank admission,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and your sincerity of thought
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is dear to me, for it has brought
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; feeling to what had long been heartless:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but I won't praise you -- let me join
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and pay my debt in the same coin
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with an avowal just as artless;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hear my confession as I stand
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I leave the verdict in your hand.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Could I be happy circumscribing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my life in a domestic plot;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had fortune blest me by prescribing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; husband and father as my lot;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; could I accept for just a minute
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the homely scene, take pleasure in it --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then I'd have looked for you alone
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to be the bride I'd call my own.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without romance, or false insistence,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'll say: with past ideals in view
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would have chosen none but you
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as helpmeet in my sad existence,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as gage of all things that were good,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and been as happy... as I could!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {112}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``But I was simply not intended
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for happiness -- that alien role.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should your perfections be expended
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in vain on my unworthy soul?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Believe (as conscience is my warrant),
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wedlock for us would be abhorrent.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'd love you, but inside a day,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with custom, love would fade away;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your tears would flow -- but your emotion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your grief would fail to touch my heart,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they'd just enrage it with their dart.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What sort of roses, in your notion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; would Hymen bring us -- blooms that might
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; last many a day, and many a night!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``What in the world is more distressing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than households where the wife must moan
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the unworthy husband through depressing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; daytimes and evenings passed alone?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and where the husband, recognizing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her worth (but anathematising
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his destiny) without a smile
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bursts with cold envy and with bile?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For such am I. When you were speaking
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to me so simply, with the fires
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and force that purity inspires,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is <i>this</i> the man that you were seeking?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can it be true you must await
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from cruel fortune such a fate?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {113}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``I've dreams and years past resurrection;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a soul that nothing can renew...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I feel a brotherly affection,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or something tenderer still, for you.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Listen to me without resentment:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; girls often change to their contentment
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; light dreams for new ones... so we see
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each springtime, on the growing tree,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fresh leaves... for such is heaven's mandate.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You'll love again, but you must teach
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your heart some self-restraint; for each
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and every man won't understand it
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as I have... learn from my belief
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that inexperience leads to grief.''
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So went his sermon. Almost dying,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; blinded to everything about
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by mist of tears, without replying
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana heard Evgeny out.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He gave his arm. In sad abstraction,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by what's called <i>machinal</i> reaction,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; without a word Tatyana leant
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; upon it, and with head down-bent
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; walked homeward round the kitchen garden;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; together they arrived, and none
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dreamt of reproving what they'd done:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by country freedom, rightful pardon
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and happy licence are allowed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as much as in Moscow the proud.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {114}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Agree, the way Eugene proceeded
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with our poor girl was kind and good;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not for the first time he succeeded
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in manifesting, as he could,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a truly noble disposition;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet people's malice and suspicion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; persisted and made no amends.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By enemies, no less by friends
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (it's all the same -- you well correct us),
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he found all kinds of brickbat hurled.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We each have enemies in this world,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but from our friends, good Lord protect us!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those friends, those friends! it is, I fear,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with cause that I've recalled them here.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What of it? Nothing. I'm just sending
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to sleep some black and empty dreams;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but, inside brackets, I'm contending
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there's no ignoble tale that seems
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cooked-up where garret-vermin babble,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; endorsed by fashionable rabble,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there's no absurdity as such,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no vulgar epigram too much,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which smilingly your friend, supported
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by decent company, has not,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; without a trace of spite or plot,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a hundred times afresh distorted;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet he'd back you through thick and thin:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he loves you... like your kith and kin!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {115}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hm, hm. Distinguished reader, tell me
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how are your <i>kith and kin</i> today?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And here my sentiments impel me
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for your enlightenment to say
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how I interpret this expression:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our kin are folk whom by profession
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we have to cherish and admire
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with all our hearts, and who require
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that in the usual Christmas scrimmage
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we visit them, or without fail
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; send them good wishes through the mail
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to ensure that till next time our image
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; won't even cross their minds by stealth...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God grant them years and years of health!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, the love of tender beauties,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; surer than friendship or than kin,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will loyally discharge its duties,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in midst of trouble, storm or din.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of course. Yet fashion's wild rotation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet a capricious inclination,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet floods of talk around the town...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the darling sex is light as down.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then verdicts from her husband's quartet
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are bound, by every virtuous wife,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to be respected all through life:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and so your faithfullest supporter
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will disappear as fast as smoke:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for Satan, love's a splendid joke.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {116}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Whom</i> then to credit? <i>Whom</i> to treasure?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On whom alone can we depend?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who is there who will truly measure
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his acts and words to suit our end?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who'll sow no calumnies around us?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose fond attentions will astound us?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who'll never fault our vices, or
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whom shall we never find a bore?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Don't let a ghost be your bear-leader,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; don't waste your efforts on the air.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just let <i>yourself</i> be your whole care,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your loved one, honourable reader!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deserving object: there can be
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nothing more lovable than he.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then what resulted from the meeting?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, it's not so hard to guess!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Love's frantic torments went on beating
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and racking with their strain and stress
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that youthful soul, which pined for sadness;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no, all devoured by passion's madness
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; poor Tanya more intensely burns;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sleep runs from her, she turns and turns...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and health, life's sweetness and its shimmer,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; smiles, and a maiden's tranquil poise,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have vanished, like an empty noise,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while dear Tatyana's youth grows dimmer:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so a storm-shadow wraps away
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in dark attire the new-born day.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {117}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poor Tanya's bloom begins to languish,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and pale, and fade without a word!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there's nothing can employ her anguish,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no sound by which her soul is stirred.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neighbours in whispered tones are taking
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; council, and with profound head-shaking
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; conclude that it's high time she wed!...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that's enough. At once, in stead,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'll gladden your imagination,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reader, by painting you a scene
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of happy love. For I have been
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; too long, against my inclination,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; held in constraint by pity's touch:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I love my Tatyana too much!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From hour to hour a surer capture
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for Olga's beauty, Lensky gives
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his soul to a delicious rapture
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that fills him and in which he lives.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He's always with her: either seated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in darkness in her room, or treated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to garden walks, as arm in arm
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they while away the morning's calm.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What else? Quite drunk with love's illusion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he even dares, once in a while,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; emboldened by his Olga's smile,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and plunged in tender shame's confusion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to play with a dishevelled tress,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or kiss the border of her dress.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {118}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He reads to Olga on occasion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for her improvement, a <i>roman</i>,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of moralistical persuasion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; more searching than Chateaubriand;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but in it there are certain pages
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (vain twaddle, fables of the ages,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; talk that might turn a young girl's head)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which with a blush he leaves unread.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As far removed as they were able
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from all the world, they sat and pored
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in deepest thought at the chess-board
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for hours, with elbows on the table --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then Lensky moved his pawn, and took,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; deep in distraction, his own rook.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even at home his occupation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is only Olga: he relieves
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with careful schemes of decoration
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an album's loose and floating sheaves.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes a landscape's represented,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a tomb, a Cyprian shrine's invented,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a lyre, and on it perched, a dove --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in ink with colour-wash above;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then on the leaves of recollection,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; below the others who have signed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he leaves a tender verse behind,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a dream's mute monument, reflection
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of instant thoughts, a fleeting trace
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; still after many years in place.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {119}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Often of course you'll have inspected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the album of a country miss
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where scribbling friends have interjected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; frontwise and back, that way and this.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With spelling scrambled to perdition,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the unmetric verses of tradition
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are entered here, in friendship's gage,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shortened, or lengthened off the page.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the first sheet you'll find a question:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Qu'ecrirez-vous sur ces tablettes?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and, under, ``toute a; vous Annette'';
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then, on the last page, the suggestion:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``who loves you more than I, let's see
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; him prove it, writing after me.''
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There you're entirely sure of finding
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; two hearts, a torch, and a nosegay;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and there, love's protestations, binding
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>until the tombstone;</i> there one day
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; some regimental bard has added
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a stanza villainously padded.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In such an album, friends, I too
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; am always glad to write, it's true,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; convinced at heart that my most zealous
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nonsense will earn indulgent looks,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor will my scribbling in such books
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; attract the sneering of the jealous,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or make men seriously discuss
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if I show wit in jesting thus.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {120}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But you, grand tomes I loathe with passion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; odd volumes from the devil's shelf,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in which the rhymester-man-of-fashion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is forced to crucify himself,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; portfolios nobly illustrated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with Tolstoy's<a href="#fn_9_2"><sup>2</sup></a> brush, or decorated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by Baratynsky's<a href="#fn_9_3"><sup>3</sup></a> wondrous pen,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God's thunder burn you up! And when
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; some splendid lady is referring
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to me her best in-quarto tome,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the fear and rage with which I foam!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deep down, an epigram is stirring
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that I'm just longing to indite --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but madrigals I've got to write!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No madrigals were for inscribing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by Lensky in his Olga's book;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his style breathed love, and not the gibing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; coldness of wit; each note he took,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each news of her he'd been imbibing --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all was material for transcribing:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with lively and pellucid look,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his elegies flow like a brook.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So you, inspired Yazy;kov,<a href="#fn_9_4"><sup>4</sup></a> sobbing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with bursts of passion from the heart,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sing God knows whom, compose with art
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a suite of elegies that, throbbing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sooner or later will relate
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the entire story of your fate.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {121}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But soft! You hear? A scowling critic,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bidding us to reject for good
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the elegy, grown paralytic,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; commands our rhymester-brotherhood:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``oh, quit your stale, your tedious quacking,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and your alas-ing and alack-ing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; about what's buried in the past:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sing about something else at last!''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All right, you want the resurrection
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of trumpet, dagger, mask and sword,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and dead ideas from that old hoard,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all brought to life at your direction.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not so? ``No, sirs, the ode's the thing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that's the refrain that you should sing,
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``as sung of old, in years of glory,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as instituted long ago.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Only the ode, that solemn story!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Enough, my friends; it's all so-so.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember the retort satiric!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is <i>Others' View,</i><a href="#fn_9_5"><sup>5</sup></a> that clever lyric,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; really more bearable to you
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than what our sorrowing rhymesters do?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``The elegy's just vain protesting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; empty the purpose it proclaims,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while odes have high and noble aims...''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That point I wouldn't mind contesting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but hold my tongue, lest it appears
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'll set two ages by the ears.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {122}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In love with fame, by freedom smitten,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with storm and tumult in his head,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what odes Vladimir might have written --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but Olga would have never read!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bards of our tearful generation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have you read lines of your creation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to your loved ones? They do maintain
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that this of all things for a swain
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is the supreme reward. Precisely,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; blest the poor lover who reads out
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his dreams, while she whom they're about,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that languid beauty, listens nicely --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; blest... though perhaps her fancy's caught
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in fact by some quite different thought.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I myself read my bedizened
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fancies, my rhythmic search for truth,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to nobody except a wizened
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nanny, companion of my youth;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or, after some dull dinner's labour,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I buttonhole a wandering neighbour
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in a corner make him choke
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on tragedy; but it's no joke,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when, utterly worn out by rhyming,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exhausted and done up, I take
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a rambling walk beside my lake,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and duck get up; with instant timing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; alarmed by my melodious lay,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they leave their shores and fly away.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {123}

<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; My gaze pursues them... but on station
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the hunter in the wood will swear
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at verse, and hiss an imprecation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and ease his catch with all due care.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We each enjoy a special hobby,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each of us has his favourite lobby:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one sees a duck and aims his gun,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one raves in verse like me, and one
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hunts cheeky flies, with swatter sweeping,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one leads the multitude in thought,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one finds in war amusing sport,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one wallows in delicious weeping;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the wine-addict adores the cup:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and good and bad are all mixed up. &gt;
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But what about Eugene? With reason
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reader, you ask, and I'll expound --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; craving your tolerance in season --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the programme of his daily round.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In summertime -- for he was leading
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a hermit's life -- he'd be proceeding
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on foot, by seven o'clock, until
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he reached the stream below the hill;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lightly attired, like the creator
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of Gulnare, he would play a card
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; out of the hand of that same bard:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he'd swim this Hellespont; then later
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he'd drink his coffee, flutter through
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the pages of some dull review,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then dress...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {124}
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Books, riding, walks, sleep heavy-laden,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the shady wood, the talking stream;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sometimes from a fair, black-eyed maiden
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the kiss where youth and freshness gleam;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a steed responsive to the bridle,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and dinner with a touch of idle
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fancy, a wine serene in mood,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tranquillity, and solitude --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin's life, you see, was holy;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unconsciously he let it mount
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its grip on him, forgot to count
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bright summer days that passed so slowly,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; forgot to think of town and friends
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and tedious means to festive ends.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XL
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our evanescent northern summer
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; parodies winter in the south;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it's like a vanishing newcomer --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but here we must control our mouth.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sky breathed autumn, time was flowing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and good old sun more seldom glowing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the days grew shorter, in the glade
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with mournful sound the secret shade
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was stripped away, and mists encroaching
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lay on the fields; in caravan
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the clamorous honking geese began
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their southward flight: one saw approaching
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the season which is such a bore --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; November stood outside the door.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {125}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dawn comes in mist and chill; no longer
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; do fields echo with work and shout;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in pairs, their hunger driving stronger,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on the highroad the wolves come out;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the horse gets wind of them and, snorting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sets the wise traveller cavorting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; up the hillside at breakneck pace;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no longer does the herdsman chase
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his beasts outdoors at dawn, nor ringing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at noontime does his horn resound
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as it assembles them around;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while in the hut a girl is singing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she spins and, friend of winter nights,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the matchwood chatters as it lights.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hoar-frost that crackles with a will is
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; already silvering all the plain...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (the reader thinks the rhyme is <i>lilies:</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; here, seize it quick for this quatrain!)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like modish parquetry, the river
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; glitters beneath its icing-sliver;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; boy-tribes with skates on loudly slice
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their joyous way across the ice;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a red-foot goose, weight something fearful,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; anticipates a swim, in stead
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tries out the ice with cautious tread,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and skids and tumbles down; the cheerful
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; first flakes of snow whirl round and sink
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in stars upon the river-brink.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {126}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In backwoods, how d'you pass this season?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Walking? The country that you roam
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is a compulsive bore by reason
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of its unvarnished monochrome.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Riding on the lugubrious prairie?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your horse, blunt-shoed and all unwary,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will find the ice elude his grip
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and, any moment, down he'll slip.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or, in your lonely homestead, moping,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you'll read: here's Pradt,<a href="#fn_9_7"><sup>7</sup></a> here's Walter Scott!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to pass the evening. No? then tot
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; up your accounts, and raging, toping,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; let evening pass, tomorrow too --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in triumph you'll see winter through!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Childe-Harold-like, Eugene's devoting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his hours to dreaming them away:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he wakes; a bath where ice is floating;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and then, indoors the livelong day,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; alone, and sunk in calculation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with a blunt cue for the duration,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from early morning on he will
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at two-ball billiards prove his skill;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then, country evening fast arriving,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; billiards are dropped, cue put to bed:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before the fire a table's spread;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Evgeny waits: and here comes driving,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with three roan horses in a line
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vladimir Lensky. Quick, let's dine!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {127}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From widow Clicquot and from Moe;t,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the draught whose blessings are agreed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in frosted bottle, for the poet
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is brought to table at full speed.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bubbles like Hippocrene are spraying;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; once, with its foaming and its playing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a simile of this and that)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it held me captive; tit for tat,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; friends, recollect how I surrendered
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my last poor lepton for a sup!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; recall, by its bewitching cup,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how many follies were engendered;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how many lines of verse, and themes
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for jokes, and rows, and merry dreams!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet hissing froth deals a malicious,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; perfidious blow to my inside,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and now it's Bordeaux the Judicious
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that I prefer to Champagne's tide;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to Ay;'s vintage in the sequel
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I find myself no longer equal;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for, mistress-like, it's brilliant, vain,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lively, capricious, and inane...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But in misfortune or displeasure,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bordeaux, you're like a faithful friend,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a true companion to the end,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ready to share our quiet leisure
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with your good offices, and so
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; long life to our dear friend, Bordeaux!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {128}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fire was dying; cinders faintly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; covered the golden coal -- the steam
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tumbled and whirled and twisted quaintly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its barely noticeable stream.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hearth was low beyond all stoking.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Straight up the chimney, pipes were smoking.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still on the board, the beakers hissed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and evening now drew on in mist...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (I like a friendly conversation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the enjoyment of a friendly drink,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at hours, which, why I cannot think,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; somehow have got the designation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of <i>time between the wolf and dog</i>.)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now hear the friends in dialogue:
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Tell me, our neighbours, are they thriving?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and how's Tatyana? Olga too,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your dashing one, is she surviving?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Just half a glass more... that will do...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All flourishing; they send their duty.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take Olga's shoulders now -- the beauty!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What breasts! What soul!... We'll go one day
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; visit the family, what d'you say?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if you come with me, they'll be flattered;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or else, my friend, how does it look?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you called there twice, and since then took
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no notice of them. But I've chattered
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so much, I'm left no time to speak!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of course! you're bidden there next week.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {129}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``I?'' ``Saturday. The invitation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Olinka and her mother sent:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana's name day celebration.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's right and proper that you went.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``But there'll be such a rout and scrabble
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with every different kind of rabble...''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``No, no, I'm sure the party's small.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Relations. No-one else at all.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let's go, our friendship's worth the labour!''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``All right, I'll come then...'' ``What a friend!''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He drained his glass down to the end
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by way of toast to their fair neighbour;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then he began to talk once more
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of Olga: love's that kind of bore!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; L
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lensky rejoiced. His designated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rapture was just two weeks ahead;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; love's crown, delectable, awaited
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his transports, and the marriage-bed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in all its mystery. Hymen's teasing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the pain, the grief, the marrow-freezing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; onset of the incipient yawn,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; were from his vision quite withdrawn.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While under the connubial banner
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can see naught, as Hymen's foe,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beyond a string of dull tableaux,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a novel in Lafontaine's<a href="#fn_9_8"><sup>8</sup></a> manner...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my wretched Lensky in his heart
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was just created for the part.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {130}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he was loved... at least he never
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; doubted of it, so lived in bliss.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Happy a hundredfold, whoever
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can lean on faith, who can dismiss
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cold reason, sleep in sensual welter
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like a drunk traveller in a shelter,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or, sweeter, like a butterfly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in flowers of spring it's drinking dry:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but piteous he, the all-foreseeing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the sober head, detesting each
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; human reaction, every speech
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the expression of its being,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whose heart experience has cooled
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and saved from being charmed or fooled!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {131}
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That year the season was belated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and autumn lingered, long and slow;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; expecting winter, nature waited --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; only in January the snow,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; night of the second, started flaking.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next day Tatyana, early waking,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; saw through the window, morning-bright,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; roofs, flowerbeds, fences, all in white,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; panes patterned by the finest printer,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with trees decked in their silvery kit,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and jolly magpies on the flit,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and hills that delicately winter
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had with its brilliant mantle crowned --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and glittering whiteness all around.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {132}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; II
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Winter!... The countryman, enchanted,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; breaks a new passage with his sleigh;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his nag has smelt the snow, and planted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a shambling hoof along the way;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a saucy kibi;tka is slicing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its furrow through the powdery icing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the driver sits and cuts a dash
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in sheepskin coat with scarlet sash.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here comes the yard-boy, who has chosen
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his pup to grace the sledge, while he
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; becomes a horse for all to see;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the rogue has got a finger frozen:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it hurts, he laughs, and all in vain
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his mother taps the window-pane.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; III
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But you perhaps find no attraction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in any picture of this kind:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for nature's unadorned reaction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has something low and unrefined.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fired by the god of inspiration,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; another bard<a href="#fn_10_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in exaltation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has painted for us the first snow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with each nuance of wintry glow:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he'll charm you with his fine invention,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he'll take you prisoner, you'll admire
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; secret sledge-rides in verse of fire;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but I've not got the least intention
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just now of wrestling with his shade,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor his,<a href="#fn_10_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who sings of Finland's maid.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {133}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tanya (profoundly Russian being,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; herself not knowing how or why)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in Russian winters thrilled at seeing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the cold perfection of the sky,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hoar-frost and sun in freezing weather,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sledges, and tardy dawns together
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with the pink glow the snows assume
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and festal evenings in the gloom.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Larins kept the old tradition:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; maid-servants from the whole estate
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; would on those evenings guess the fate
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the two girls; their premonition
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pointed each year, for time to come,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at soldier-husbands, and the drum.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; V
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana shared with full conviction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the simple faith of olden days
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in dreams and cards and their prediction,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and portents of the lunar phase.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Omens dismayed her with their presage;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each object held a secret message
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for her instruction, and her breast
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was by forebodings much oppressed.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The tomcat, mannered and affected,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that sat above the stove and purred
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and washed its face, to her brought word
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that visitors must be expected.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If suddenly aloft she spied
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the new moon, horned, on her left side,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {134}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her face would pale, she'd start to quiver.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the dark sky, a shooting star
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that fell, and then began to shiver,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; would fill Tatyana from afar
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with perturbation and with worry;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and while the star still flew, she'd hurry
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to whisper it her inmost prayer.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if she happened anywhere
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to meet a black monk, or if crossing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her path a hare in headlong flight
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ran through the fields, sheer panic fright
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; would leave her dithering and tossing.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By dire presentiment awestruck,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; already she'd assume ill-luck.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet -- fear itself she found presented
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a hidden beauty in the end:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our disposition being invented
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by nature, contradiction's friend.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Christmas came on. What joy, what gladness!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, youth divines, in giddy madness,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; youth which has nothing to regret,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before which life's horizon yet
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lies bright, and vast beyond perceiving;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; spectacled age divines as well,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; although it's nearly heard the knell,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and all is lost beyond retrieving;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no matter: hope, in child's disguise,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is there to lisp its pack of lies.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {135}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana looks with pulses racing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at sunken wax inside a bowl:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beyond a doubt, its wondrous tracing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; foretells for her some wondrous role;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from dish of water, rings are shifted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in due succession; hers is lifted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and at the very self-same time
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the girls sing out the ancient rhyme:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``The peasants there have wealth abounding,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they heap up silver with a spade;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and those we sing for will be paid
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in goods and fame!'' But the sad-sounding
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ditty portends a loss; more dear
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is ``Kit''<a href="#fn_10_3"><sup>3</sup></a> to every maiden's ear.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sky is clear, the earth is frozen;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the heavenly lights in glorious quire
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tread the calm, settled path they've chosen...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana in low-cut attire
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; goes out into the courtyard spaces
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and trains a mirror till it faces
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the moon; but in the darkened glass
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the only face to shake and pass
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is sad old moon's... Hark! snow is creaking...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a passer-by; and on tiptoe
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she flies as fast as she can go;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and ``what's your name?'' she asks him, speaking
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in a melodious, flute-like tone.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He looks, and answers: ``Agafon.''<a href="#fn_10_4"><sup>4</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {136}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; X
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prepared for prophecy and fable,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she did what nurse advised she do
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in the bath-house had a table
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that night, in secret, set for two;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then sudden fear attacked Tatyana...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I too -- when I recall Svetlana<a href="#fn_10_5"><sup>5</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm terrified -- so let it be...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana's rites are not for me.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She's dropped her sash's silken billow;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tanya's undressed, and lies in bed.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lel<a href="#fn_10_6"><sup>6</sup></a> floats about above her head;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and underneath her downy pillow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a young girl's looking-glass is kept.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now all was still. Tatyana slept.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She dreamt of portents. In her dreaming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she walked across a snowy plain
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; through gloom and mist; and there came streaming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a furious, boiling, heaving main
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; across the drift-encumbered acres,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a raging torrent, capped with breakers,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a flood on which no frosty band
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had been imposed by winter's hand;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; two poles that ice had glued like plaster
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; were placed across the gulf to make
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a flimsy bridge whose every quake
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; spelt hazard, ruin and disaster;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she stopped at the loud torrent's bound,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; perplexed... and rooted to the ground.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {137}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if before some mournful parting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana groaned above the tide;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she saw no friendly figure starting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to help her from the other side;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but suddenly a snowdrift rumbled,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and what came out? a hairy, tumbled,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; enormous bear; Tatyana yelled,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the bear let out a roar, and held
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a sharp-nailed paw towards her; bracing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her nerves, she leant on it her weight,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and with a halting, trembling gait
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; above the water started tracing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her way; she passed, then as she walked
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the bear -- what next? -- behind her stalked.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A backward look is fraught with danger;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she speeds her footsteps to a race,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but from her shaggy-liveried ranger
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she can't escape at any pace --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the odious bear still grunts and lumbers.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ahead of them a pinewood slumbers
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the full beauty of its frown;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the branches all are weighted down
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with tufts of snow; and through the lifted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; summits of aspen, birch and lime,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the nightly luminaries climb.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No path to see: the snow has drifted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; across each bush, across each steep,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and all the world is buried deep.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {138}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She's in the wood, the bear still trails her.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's powdery snow up to her knees;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now a protruding branch assails her
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and clasps her neck; and now she sees
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her golden earrings off and whipping;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and now the crunchy snow is stripping
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her darling foot of its wet shoe,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her handkerchief has fallen too;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no time to pick it up -- she's dying
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with fright, she hears the approaching bear;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her fingers shake, she doesn't dare
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to lift her skirt up; still she's flying,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and he pursuing, till at length
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she flies no more, she's lost her strength.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She's fallen in the snow -- alertly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the bear has raised her in his paws;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and she, submissively, inertly --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no move she makes, no breath she draws;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he whirls her through the wood... a hovel
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shows up through trees, all of a grovel
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in darkest forest depths and drowned
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by dreary snowdrifts piled around;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there's a small window shining in it,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and from within come noise and cheer;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the bear explains: ``my cousin's here --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; come in and warm yourself a minute!''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he carries her inside the door
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and sets her gently on the floor.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {139}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana looks, her faintness passes:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bear's gone; a hallway, no mistake;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; behind the door the clash of glasses
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and shouts suggest a crowded wake;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so, seeing there no rhyme or reason,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no meaning in or out of season,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she peers discreetly through a chink
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and sees... whatever do you think?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a group of monsters round a table,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a dog with horns, a goatee'd witch,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a rooster head, and on the twitch
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a skeleton jerked by a cable,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a dwarf with tail, and a half-strain,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a hybrid cross of cat and crane.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But ever stranger and more fearful:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a crayfish rides on spider-back;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on goose's neck, a skull looks cheerful
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and swaggers in a red calpack;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with bended knees a windmill dances,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its sails go flap-flap as it prances;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; song, laughter, whistle, bark and champ,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and human words, and horse's stamp!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But how she jumped, when in this hovel
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; among the guests she recognized
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the man she feared and idolized --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who else? -- the hero of our novel!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin sits at table too,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he eyes the door, looks slyly through.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {140}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He nods -- they start to fuss and truckle;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he drinks -- all shout and take a swill;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he laughs -- they all begin to chuckle;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he scowls -- and the whole gang are still;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tanya's no longer quite so frightened
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and, curious now about the lot,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; opens the door a tiny slot...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but then a sudden breeze surprises,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; puts out the lamps; the whole brigade
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of house-familiars stands dismayed...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with eyes aflame Onegin rises
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from table, clattering on the floor;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all stand. He walks towards the door.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now she's alarmed; in desperate worry
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana struggles to run out --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she can't; and in her panic hurry
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she flails around, she tries to shout --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she can't; Evgeny's pushed the portal,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and to the vision of those mortal
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; monsters the maiden stood revealed.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wildly the fearful laughter pealed;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the eyes of all, the hooves, the snozzles,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the bleeding tongues, the tufted tails,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the tusks, the corpse's finger-nails,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the horns, and the moustachio'd nozzles --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all point at her, and all combine
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to bellow out: ``she's mine, she's mine.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {141}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``She's <i>mine!</i>'' Evgeny's voice of thunder
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; clears in a flash the freezing room;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the whole thieves' kitchen flies asunder,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the girl remains there in the gloom
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; alone with him; Onegin takes her
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; into a corner, gently makes her
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sit on a flimsy bench, and lays
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his head upon her shoulder... blaze
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of sudden brightness... it's too curious...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Olga's appeared upon the scene,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and Lensky follows her... Eugene,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eyes rolling, arms uplifted, furious,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; damns the intruders; Tanya lies
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and almost swoons, and almost dies.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Louder and louder sounds the wrangle:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eugene has caught up, quick as quick,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a carving-knife -- and in the tangle
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lensky's thrown down. The murk is thick
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and growing thicker; then, heart-shaking,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a scream rings out... the cabin's quaking...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tanya comes to in utter fright...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she looks, the room is getting light --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; outside, the scarlet rays of dawning
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; play on the window's frosted lace;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in through the door, at swallow's pace,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pinker than glow of Northern morning,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; flits Olga: ``now, tell me straight out,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who was it that you dreamt about?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {142}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deaf to her sister's intervention,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana simply lay in bed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; devoured a book with rapt attention,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and kept quite silent while she read.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The book displayed, not so you'd know it,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no magic fancies of the poet,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no brilliant truth, no vivid scene;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and yet by Vergil or Racine
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by Scott, by Seneca, or Byron,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; even by <i>Ladies' Fashion Post,</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no one was ever so engrossed:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Martin Zadeka was the siren,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dean of Chaldea's learned team,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; arch-commentator of the dream.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This work of the profoundest learning
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was brought there by a huckster who
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one day came down that lonely turning,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and to Tanya, when he was through,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; swapped it for odd tomes of <i>Malvina,</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but just to make the bargain keener,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he charged three roubles and a half,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and took two <i>Petriads</i> in calf,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a grammar, a digest of fable,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and volume three of Marmontel.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since then Martin Zadeka's spell
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bewitches Tanya... he is able
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to comfort her in all her woes,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and every night shares her repose.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {143}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana's haunted by her vision,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; plagued by her ghastly dream, and tries
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to puzzle out with some precision
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just what the nightmare signifies.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Searching the table exegetic
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she finds, in order alphabetic:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bear, blackness, blizzard, bridge and crow,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fir, forest, hedgehog, raven, snow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; etcetera. But her trepidation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Martin Zadeka fails to mend;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the horrid nightmare must portend
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a hideous deal of tribulation.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For several days she peaked and pined
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in deep anxiety of mind.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now Aurora's crimson fingers
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from daybreak valleys lift the sun;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the morning light no longer lingers,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the festal name day has begun.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since dawn, whole families have been driving
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; towards the Larins' and arriving
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in sledded coaches and coupes,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in britzkas, kibi;tkas and sleighs.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hall is full of noise and hustle,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the salon new faces meet,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and kisses smack as young girls greet;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there's yap of pugs, and laughs, and bustle;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the threshold's thronged, wet-nurses call,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; guests bow, feet scrape, and children squall.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {144}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here with his wife, that bulging charmer,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fat Pu;styakov has driven in;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gvozdi;n, exemplary farmer,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whose serfs are miserably thin;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the Skoti;nins, grizzled sages,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with broods of children of all ages,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from thirty down to two; and stop,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; here's Petushko;v, the local fop;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and look, my cousin's come, Buya;nov,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in a peaked cap, all dust and fluff, --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you'll recognize him soon enough, --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and counsellor (retired) Flya;nov,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that rogue, backbiter, pantaloon,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bribe-taker, glutton and buffoon.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here, in his red peruke and glasses,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; late of Tambov, Monsieur Triquet
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has come with Kharlikov; he passes
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for witty; in his Gallic way
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inside a pocket Triquet nurses,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; addressed to Tanya, certain verses
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set to well-known children's glee:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``reveillez-vous, belle endormie.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He found them in some old collection,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; printed among outmoded airs;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Triquet, ingenious poet, dares
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to undertake their resurrection,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and for <i>belle Nina,</i> as it read,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he's put <i>belle Tatiana</i> instead.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {145}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And from the nearby Army station
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Major's here: he's all the rage
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with our Mamas, and a sensation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with demoiselles of riper age;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his news has set the party humming!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the regimental band is coming,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sent at the Colonel's own behest.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A ball: the joy of every guest!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Young ladies jump for future blisses...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But dinner's served, so two by two
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and arm in arm they all go through;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; round Tanya congregate the misses,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the men confront them, face to face:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they sit, they cross themselves for grace.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They buzz -- but then all talk's suspended --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jaws masticate as minutes pass:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the crash of plates and knives is blended
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with the resounding chime of glass.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And now there's gradually beginning
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; among the guests a general dinning:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; none listens when the others speak,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all shout and argue, laugh and squeak.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then doors are opened, Lensky enters,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin too. ``Good Lord, at last!''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the hostess cries and, moving fast,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the guests squeeze closer to the centres;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they shove each plate, and every chair,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and shout, and make room for the pair.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {146}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just facing Tanya's where they're sitting;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and paler than the moon at dawn,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she lowers darkened eyes, unwitting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and trembles like a hunted fawn.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From violent passions fast pulsating
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she's nearly swooned, she's suffocating;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the friends' salute she never hears
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and from her eyes the eager tears
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are almost bursting; she's quite ready,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; poor girl, to drop into a faint,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but will, and reason's strong constraint,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; prevailed, and with composure steady
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she sat there; through her teeth a word
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; came out so soft, it scarce was heard.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The nervous-tragical reaction,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; girls' tears, their swooning, for Eugene
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had long proved tedious to distraction:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he knew too well that sort of scene.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, faced with this enormous revel,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he'd got annoyed, the tricky devil.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He saw the sad girl's trembling state,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; looked down in an access of hate,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pouted, and swore in furious passion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to wreak, by stirring Lensky's ire,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the best revenge one could desire.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Already, in exultant fashion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he watched the guests and, as he dined,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; caricatured them in his mind.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {147}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tanya's distress had risked detection
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not only by Evgeny's eye;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but looks and talk took the direction,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that moment, of a luscious pie
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (alas, too salted); now they're bringing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bottles to which some pitch is clinging:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tsimlyansky wine, between the meat
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the <i>blancmanger,</i> then a fleet
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of goblets, tall and slender pretties;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how they remind me of your stem,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Zizi, my crystal and my gem,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you object of my guileless ditties!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with draughts from love's enticing flask,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you made me drunk as one could ask!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Freed from its dripping cork, the bottle
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; explodes; wine fizzes up... but stay:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; solemn, too long compelled to throttle
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his itching verse, Monsieur Triquet
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is on his feet -- in utter stillness
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the party waits. Seized with an illness
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of swooning, Tanya nearly dies;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and, scroll in hand, before her eyes
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Triquet sings, out of tune. Loud clapping
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and cheers salute him. Tanya must
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thank him by curtseying to the dust;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; great bard despite his modest trapping,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he's first to toast her in the bowl,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then he presents her with the scroll.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {148}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Compliment and congratulation;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tanya thanks each one with a phrase.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Eugene's turn for salutation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; arrives, the girl's exhausted gaze,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her discomposure, her confusion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; expose his soul to an intrusion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of pity: in his silent bow,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in his look there shows somehow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a wondrous tenderness. And whether
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it was that he'd been truly stirred,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or half-unwittingly preferred
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a joking flirt, or both together,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there was a softness in his glance:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it brought back Tanya from her trance.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chairs are pushed outward, loudly rumbling,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and all into the salon squeeze,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as from their luscious hive go tumbling
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fieldward, in noisy swarm, the bees.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The banquet's given no cause for sneezing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; neighbours in high content are wheezing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ladies at the fireside confer,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in corners whispering girls concur;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now, by green tablecloths awaited,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the eager players are enrolled --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Boston and ombre for the old,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and whist, that's now so keenly fe;ted --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pursuits of a monotonous breed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; begot by boredom out of greed.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {149}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By now whist's heroes have completed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eight rubbers; and by now eight times
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they've moved around and been reseated;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and tea's brought in. Instead of chimes
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I like to tell the time by dinner
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and tea and supper; there's an inner
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; clock in the country rings the hour;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no fuss; our belly has the power
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of any Breguet: and in passing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'll just remark, my verses talk
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as much of banquets and the cork
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and eatables beyond all classing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as yours did, Homer, godlike lord,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whom thirty centuries have adored!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; XXXVII<a href="#fn_10_7"><sup>7</sup></a>
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At feasts, though, full of pert aggression,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I put your genius to the test,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I make magnanimous confession,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in other things you come off best:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your heroes, raging and ferocious,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your battles, lawless and atrocious,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your Zeus, your Cypris, your whole band
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have clearly got the upper hand
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of Eugene, cold as all creation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of plains where boredom reigns complete,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or of Isto;mina, my sweet,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and all our modish education;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but your vile Helen's not my star --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no, Tanya's more endearing far.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {150}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No one will think that worth gainsaying,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; though Menelaus, in Helen's name,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; may spend a century in flaying
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the hapless Phrygians all the same,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and although Troy's greybeards, collected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; around Priam the much-respected,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; may chorus, when she comes in sight,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that Menelaus was quite right --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and Paris too. But hear my pleading:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as battles go, I've not begun;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; don't judge the race before it's run --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be good enough to go on reading:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there'll be a fight. For that I give
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my word; no welshing, as I live. &gt;
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here's tea: the girls have just, as bidden,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; taken the saucers in their grip,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when, from behind the doorway, hidden
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bassoons and flutes begin to trip.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Elated by the music's blaring,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Petushko;v, local Paris, tearing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his tea with rum quite left behind,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; approaches Olga; Lensky's signed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana on; Miss Kharlikova,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that nubile maid of riper age,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is seized by Tambov's poet-sage;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Buya;nov whirls off Pustyakova;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they all have swarmed into the hall,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in full brilliance shines the ball.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {151}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XL
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right at the outset of my story
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (if you'll turn back to chapter one)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I meant to paint, with Alban's<a href="#fn_10_8"><sup>8</sup></a> glory,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a ball in Petersburg; but fun
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and charming reverie's vain deflection
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; absorbed me in the recollection
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of certain ladies' tiny feet.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Enough I've wandered in the suite
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of your slim prints! though this be treason
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to my young days, it's time I turned
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to wiser words and deeds, and learned
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to demonstrate some signs of reason:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; let no more such digressions lurk
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in this fifth chapter of my work.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And now, monotonously dashing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like mindless youth, the waltz goes by
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with spinning noise and senseless flashing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as pair by pair the dancers fly.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Revenge's hour is near, and after
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Evgeny, full of inward laughter,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has gone to Olga, swept the girl
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; past all the assembly in a whirl,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he takes her to a chair, beginning
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to talk of this and that, but then
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; after two minutes, off again,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they're on the dance-floor, waltzing, spinning.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All are dumbfounded. Lensky shies
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; away from trusting his own eyes.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {152}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now the mazurka sounds. Its thunder
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; used in times past to ring a peal
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that huge ballrooms vibrated under,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while floors would split from crash of heel,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and frames would shudder, windows tremble;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now things are changed, now we resemble
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ladies who glide on waxed parquet.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet the mazurka keeps today
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in country towns and suchlike places
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its pristine charm: heeltaps, and leaps,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and whiskers -- all of this it keeps
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as fresh as ever, for its graces
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are here untouched by fashion's reign,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our modern Russia's plague and bane.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLIII<a href="#fn_10_7"><sup>7</sup></a>
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... ...
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; Petushko;v's nails and spurs are sounding
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (that half-pay archivist); and bounding
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Buya;nov's heels have split the wood
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and wrecked the flooring-boards for good;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there's crashing, rumbling, pounding, trotting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the deeper in the wood, the more
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the logs; the wild ones have the floor;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they're plunging, whirling, all but squatting.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ah, gently, gently, easy goes --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your heels will squash the ladies' toes! &gt;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {153}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Buya;nov, my vivacious cousin,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; leads Olga and Tatyana on
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to Eugene; nineteen to the dozen,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eugene takes Olga, and is gone;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he steers her, nonchalantly gliding,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he stoops and, tenderly confiding,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whispers some ballad of the hour,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; squeezes her hand -- and brings to flower
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on her smug face a flush of pleasure.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lensky has watched: his rage has blazed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he's lost his self-command, and crazed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with jealousy beyond all measure
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; insists, when the mazurka ends,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on the cotillion, as amends.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He asks. She can't accept. Why ever?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No, she's already pledged her word
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to Evgeny. Oh, God, she'd never...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How could she? why, he'd never heard...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; scarce out of bibs, already fickle,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fresh from the cot, an infant pickle,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; already studying to intrigue,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; already high in treason's league!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He finds the shock beyond all bearing:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so, cursing women's devious course,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he leaves the house, calls for his horse
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and gallops. Pistols made for pairing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and just a double charge of shot
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will in a flash decide his lot.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {154}
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seeing Vladimir had defected,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eugene, at Olga's side, was racked
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by fresh <i>ennui</i> as he reflected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with pleasure on his vengeful act.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Olinka yawned, just like her neighbour,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and looked for Lensky, while the labour
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the cotillion's endless theme
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; oppressed her like a heavy dream.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's over. Supper is proceeding.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beds are made up; the guests are all
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; packed from the maids' wing to the hall.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each one by now is badly needing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a place for rest. Eugene alone
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has driven off, to find his own.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {155}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; II
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All sleep: from the saloon a roaring
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; proclaims where ponderous Pu;styakov
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beside his heavier half is snoring.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gvozdi;n, Buya;nov, Petushko;v
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and Flya;nov, amply lubricated,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on dining-chairs are all prostrated;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the floor serves Triquet for his nap,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in flannel, and an old fur cap.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the two sisters' rooms extended,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the maidens all are slumbering deep.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Only Tatyana does not sleep,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but at the window, in the splendid
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; radiance of Dian, sits in pain
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and looks out on the darkened plain.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; III
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His unexpected apparition,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the fleeting tenderness that stole
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; into his look, the exhibition
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with Olga, all have pierced her soul;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she can't make out a single fraction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of his intent; and a reaction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of jealousy has made her start,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as if a cold hand squeezed her heart,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as if beneath her, dark and rumbling,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a gulf has gaped... Says Tanya: ``I
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; am doomed to perish, yet to die
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; through him is sweetness' self. In grumbling
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I find no sense; the truth is this,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it's not in him to bring me bliss.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {156}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But onward, onward with my story!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A new acquaintance claims our quill.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Five versts or so from Krasnogo;rie,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lensky's estate, there lives and still
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thrives to this moment, in a station
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of philosophic isolation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Zaretsky, sometime king of brawls
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and hetman of the gambling-halls,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; arch-rake, pothouse tribune-persona,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but now grown plain and kind in stead,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; paterfamilias (unwed),
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unswerving friend, correct landowner,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and even honourable man:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so, if we want to change, we can!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; V
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The world of fashion, prone to flatter,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; praised his fierce courage in its day:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; true, with a pistol he could shatter
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an ace a dozen yards away;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it's also true, in battle's rapture,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the circumstances of his capture
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had made his name, when, bold as bold,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; down from his Kalmuck steed he rolled
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; into the mud, a drunken goner,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and taken by the French -- some prize! --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; resigned himself to prison's ties,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like Regulus, that god of honour,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in order daily, chez Very,<a href="#fn_11_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to drain, on credit, bottles three.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {157}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Time was, he'd been the wittiest ever,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so brilliantly he'd hoax the fools,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so gloriously he'd fool the clever,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; using overt or covert rules.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes his tricks would earn him trouble,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or cause the bursting of his bubble,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sometimes he'd fall into a trap
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; himself just like a simple chap.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he could draw a joking moral,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return an answer, blunt or keen,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; use cunning silence as a screen,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or cunningly create a quarrel,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; get two young friends to pick a fight,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and put them on a paced-out site.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or he knew how to reconcile them
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so that all three went off to lunch,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then later slyly he'd revile them
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with lies and jokes that packed a punch:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>sed alia tempora!</i> The devil
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (like passion's dream, that other revel)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; goes out of us when youth is dead.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So my Zaretsky, as I said,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beneath bird-cherries and acacias
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has found a port for his old age,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and lives, a veritable sage,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for planting cabbage, like Horatius,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and breeding ducks and geese as well,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and teaching children how to spell.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {158}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was no fool; appreciated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by my Eugene, not for his heart,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but for the effect that he created
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of sense and judgement. For his part
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his converse gave Onegin pleasure;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so it was not in any measure,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the morning after, a surprise
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when our Zaretsky met his eyes.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His visitor from the beginning
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; broke greetings off, and gave Eugene
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a note from Lensky; in between
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Zaretsky watched, and stood there grinning.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin without more ado
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; crossed to the window, read it through.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pleasant, in spite of its compression,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gentlemanly, quite precise,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vladimir's challenge found expression
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that, though polite, was clear as ice.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eugene's response was automatic;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he informed this envoy diplomatic
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in terms where not a word was spared:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>at any time he'd be prepared.</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Zaretsky rose without discussion;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he saw no point in staying on,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with work at home; but when he'd gone,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Evgeny, whom the repercussion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; left quite alone with his own soul,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was far from happy with his role.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {159}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; X
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With reason, too: for when he'd vetted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in secret judgement what he'd done,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he found too much that he regretted:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; last night he'd erred in making fun,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so heartless and so detrimental,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of love so timorous and gentle.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In second place the poet might
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have been a fool; yet he'd a right,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at eighteen years, to some compassion.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Evgeny loved him from his heart,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and should have played a different part:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no softball for the winds of fashion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no boy, to fight or take offence --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the <i>man</i> of honour and of sense.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He could have spoken without harming,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; need not have bristled like a beast;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he should have settled for disarming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that youthful heart. ``But now at least
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it's late, time's passing... not to mention,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in our affair, the intervention
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of that old duellistic fox,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that wicked, loose-tongue chatterbox...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; True, scorn should punish and should bridle
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his wit, according to the rules
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but whispers, the guffaw of fools...''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Public opinion -- here's our idol,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the spring of honour, and the pin
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on which the world is doomed to spin.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {160}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lensky at home awaits the answer,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; impatient, hatred flaming high;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but here comes our loud-talking prancer
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who swaggers in with the reply.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The jealous poet's gloom is lightened!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; knowing the offender, he'd been frightened
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lest he should by some clever trick
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; avert his chest from pistol's click,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; smoothe his way out with humour's ointment.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now Vladimir's doubts are still:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; early tomorrow at the mill
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before first light they have appointment,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to raise the safety catch and strain
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to hit the target: thigh or brain.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still blazing with resentment's fuel,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and set on hating the coquette,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lensky resolved before the duel
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not to see Olga; in a fret
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; watched sun and clock -- then by such labours
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; defeated, turned up at his neighbour's.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He thought that Olga'd be confused,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; struck down as if she'd been accused,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when he arrived; not in the slightest:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just as she'd always been, she tripped
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to meet the unhappy poet, skipped
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; down from the porch, light as the lightest,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the giddiest hope, carefree and gay,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the same as any other day.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {161}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Last night, what made you fly so early?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was the first thing that Olga said.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All Lensky's thoughts went hurly-burly,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and silently he hung his head.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rage died, and jealousy's obsession,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before such candour of expression,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; such frank <i>tendresse;</i> away they stole
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before such playfulness of soul!...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he looks, in sweet irresolution,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and then concludes: she loves him yet!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Already borne down by regret,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he almost begs for absolution,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he trembles, knows not what to tell;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he's happy, yes, he's almost well...
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (XV, XVI,<a href="#fn_11_2"><sup>2</sup></a>) XVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now brooding thoughts hold his attention
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; once more, at that beloved sight,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and so he lacks the strength to mention
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the happenings of the previous night;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he murmurs: ``Olga's mine for saving;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'll stop that tempter from depraving
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her youth with all his repertoire
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of sighs, and compliments, and fire;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that poisonous worm, despised, degrading,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shall not attack my lily's root;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'll save this blossom on the shoot,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; still hardly opened up, from fading.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Friends, all this meant was: I've a date
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for swapping bullets with my mate.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {162}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If only Lensky'd known the burning
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wound that had seared my Tanya's heart!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If Tanya'd had the chance of learning
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that Lensky and Eugene, apart,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; would settle, on the morrow morning,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for which of them the tomb was yawning,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; perhaps her love could in the end
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have reunited friend to friend!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, even by accident, her passion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was undiscovered to that day.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin had no word to say;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana pined in secret fashion:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the whole world, her nurse alone,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if not slow-witted, might have known.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lensky all evening, in distraction,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; would talk, keep silent, laugh, then frown --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the quintessential reaction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of Muses' offspring; sitting down
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before the clavichord with knitted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; forehead, he strummed, his vision flitted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to Olga's face, he whispered low
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``I think I'm happy.'' Time to go,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the hour was late. And now from aching
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the heart inside him seemed to shrink;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; parting with Olga made him think
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it was quite torn in half and breaking.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She faced him, questioning: ``But you?...''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``It's nothing.'' And away he flew.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {163}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Once home, he brought out and inspected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his pistols, laid them in their case,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; undressed, by candlelight selected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and opened Schiller... but the embrace
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of one sole thought holds him in keeping
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and stops his doleful heart from sleeping:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Olga is there, he sees her stand
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in untold beauty close at hand.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vladimir shuts the book, for writing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; prepares himself; and then his verse,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; compact of amorous trash, and worse,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; flows and reverberates. Reciting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he sounds, in lyric frenzy sunk,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like Delvig<a href="#fn_11_3"><sup>3</sup></a> when he's dining drunk.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By chance those verses haven't vanished;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I keep them, and will quote them here:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Whither, oh whither are ye banished,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my golden days when spring was dear?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What fate is my tomorrow brewing?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the answer's past all human viewing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it's hidden deep in gloom and dust.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No matter; fate's decree is just.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether the arrow has my number,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whether it goes careering past,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all's well; the destined hour at last
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; comes for awakening, comes for slumber;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; blessed are daytime's care and cark,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; blest is the advent of the dark!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {164}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``The morning star will soon be shining,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and soon will day's bright tune be played;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but I perhaps will be declining
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; into the tomb's mysterious shade;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the trail the youthful poet followed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by sluggish Lethe may be swallowed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and I be by the world forgot;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but, lovely maiden, wilt thou not
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on my untimely urn be weeping,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thinking: he loved me, and in strife
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the sad beginnings of his life
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he consecrated to my keeping?...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Friend of my heart, be at my side,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beloved friend, thou art my bride!''
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So Lensky wrote, obscurely, limply
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (in the romantic style, we say,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; though what's romantic here I simply
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fail to perceive -- that's by the way).
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At last, with dawn upon him, stooping
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his weary head, and softly drooping
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; over the modish word <i>ideal,</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he dozed away; but when the real
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; magic of sleep had started claiming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its due oblivion, in the hush
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his neighbour entered at a rush
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and wakened Lensky by exclaiming:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Get up: it's gone six! I'll be bound,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin's waiting on the ground.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {165}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he's mistaken: Eugene's lying
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and sleeping sounder than a rock.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By now the shades of night are flying,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vesper is met by crow of cock --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin still is slumbering deeply.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By now the sun is climbing steeply,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and little dancing whirls of snow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; glitter and tumble as they go,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but Eugene hasn't moved; for certain
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; slumber still floats above his head.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At last he wakes, and stirs in bed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and parts the fringes of his curtain;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he looks, and sees the hour of day --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; high time he should be on his way.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He rings at once, and what a scurry!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his French valet, Guillot, is there
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with gown and slippers; tearing hurry,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as linen's brought for him to wear.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And while with all despatch he's dressing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he warns his man for duty, stressing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that with him to the trysting-place
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he has to bring the battle-case.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By now the sledge is at the portal --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he's racing millward like a bird.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arrived apace, he gives the word
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to bring across Lepage's<a href="#fn_11_4"><sup>4</sup></a> mortal
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; barrels, and then to drive aside
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by two small oaktrees in a ride.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {166}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While Lensky'd long been meditating
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; impatiently on the mill-dam,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Zaretsky, engineer-in-waiting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; condemned the millstones as a sham.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin comes, and makes excuses;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but in Zaretsky he induces
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; amazement: ``Where's your second gone?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In duels a pedantic don,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; methodical by disposition,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a classicist, he'll not allow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that one be shot just anyhow --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; only by rule, and strict tradition
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inherited from earlier days
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (for which he must receive due praise).
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Evgeny echoed him: ``My second?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He's here -- Monsieur Guillot, my friend.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I had most surely never reckoned
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his choice could shock or might offend;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; though he's unknown, there's no suggestion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that he's not honest past all question.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Zaretsky bit his lip. Eugene
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; asked Lensky: ``Should we start, I mean?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vladimir to this casual mention
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; replies: ``We might as well.'' They walk
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; behind the mill. In solemn talk,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Zaretsky draws up a convention
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with Guillot; while pourparlers last
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the two foes stand with eyes downcast.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {167}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Foes! Is it long since from each other
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the lust for blood drew them apart?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; long since, like brother linked to brother,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they shared their days in deed and heart,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their table, and their hours of leisure?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now, in this vindictive pleasure
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hereditary foes they seem,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and as in some appalling dream
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each coldly plans the other's slaughter...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; could they not laugh out loud, before
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their hands are dipped in scarlet gore,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; could they not give each other quarter
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and part in kindness? Just the same,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all modish foes dread worldly shame.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pistols are out, they gleam, the hammer
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thumps as the balls are pressed inside
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; faceted muzzles by the rammer;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with a first click, the catch is tried.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now powder's greyish stream is slipping
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; into the pan. Securely gripping,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the jagged flint's pulled back anew.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Guillot, behind a stump in view,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stands in dismay and indecision.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And now the two opponents doff
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their cloaks; Zaretsky's measured off
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thirty-two steps with great precision,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and on their marks has made them stand;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each grips his pistol in his hand.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {168}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Now march.'' And calmly, not yet seeking
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to aim, at steady, even pace
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the foes, cold-blooded and unspeaking,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each took four steps across the space,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; four fateful stairs. Then, without slowing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the level tenor of his going,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Evgeny quietly began
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to lift his pistol up. A span
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of five more steps they went, slow-gaited,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and Lensky, left eye closing, aimed --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but just then Eugene's pistol flamed...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The clock of doom had struck as fated;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the poet, without a sound,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; let fall his pistol on the ground.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vladimir drops, hand softly sliding
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to heart. And in his misted gaze
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is death, not pain. So gently gliding
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; down slopes of mountains, when a blaze
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of sunlight makes it flash and crumble,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a block of snow will slip and tumble.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin, drenched with sudden chill,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; darts to the boy, and looks, and still
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; calls out his name... All unavailing:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the youthful votary of rhyme
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has found an end before his time.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The storm is over,<a href="#fn_11_5"><sup>5</sup></a> dawn is paling,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the bloom has withered on the bough;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the altar flame's extinguished now.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {169}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He lay quite still, and strange as dreaming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was that calm brow of one who swooned.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shot through below the chest -- and streaming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the blood came smoking from the wound.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A moment earlier, inspiration
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had filled this heart, and detestation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and hope and passion; life had glowed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and blood had bubbled as it flowed;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but now the mansion is forsaken;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shutters are up, and all is pale
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and still within, behind the veil
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of chalk the window-panes have taken.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The lady of the house has fled.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where to, God knows. The trail is dead.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With a sharp epigram it's pleasant
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to infuriate a clumsy foe;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and, as observer, to be present
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and watch him stubbornly bring low
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his thrusting horns, and as he passes
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; blush to descry in looking-glasses
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his foolish face; more pleasant yet
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to hear him howl: ``that's me!'' You'll get
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; more joy still when with mute insistence
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you help him to an honoured fate
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by calmly aiming at his pate
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from any gentlemanly distance;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but when you've managed his despatch
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you won't find that quite so much catch...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {170}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What if your pistol-shot has smitten
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a friend of yours in his first youth
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; because some glance of his has bitten
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your pride, some answer, or in truth
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; some nonsense thrown up while carousing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or if himself, with rage arousing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he's called you out -- say, in your soul
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what feelings would assume control
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if, motionless, no life appearing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; death on his brow, your friend should lie,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stiffening as the hours go by,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before you on the ground, unhearing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unspeaking, too, but stretched out there
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; deaf to the voice of your despair?
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Giving his pistol-butt a squeezing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Evgeny looks at Lensky, chilled
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at heart by grim remorse's freezing.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Well, what?'' the neighbour says, ``he's killed.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Killed!... At this frightful word a-quiver,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin turns, and with a shiver
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; summons his people. On the sleigh
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with care Zaretsky stows away
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the frozen corpse, drives off, and homing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vanishes with his load of dread.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The horses, as they sense the dead,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have snorted, reared, and whitely foaming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have drenched the steel bit as they go
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and flown like arrows from a bow.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {171}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My friends, the bard stirs your compassion:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; right in the flower of joyous hope,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hope that he's had no time to fashion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for men to see, still in the scope
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of swaddling clothes -- already blighted!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where is the fire that once ignited,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where's the high aim, the ardent sense
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of youth, so tender, so intense?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and where is love's tempestuous yearning,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where are the reveries this time,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the horror of disgrace and crime,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the thirst for work, the lust for learning,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and life celestial's phantom gleams,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stuff of the poet's hallowed dreams!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps to improve the world's condition,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; perhaps for fame, he was endowed;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his lyre, now stilled, in its high mission
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; might have resounded long and loud
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for aeons. Maybe it was fated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that on the world's staircase there waited
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for him a lofty stair. His shade,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; after the martyr's price it paid,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; maybe bore off with it for ever
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a secret truth, and at our cost
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a life-creating voice was lost;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to it the people's blessing never
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will reach, and past the tomb's compound
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hymns of the ages never sound.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {172}
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps however, to be truthful,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he would have found a normal fate.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The years would pass; no longer youthful,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he'd see his soul cool in its grate;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his nature would be changed and steadied,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he'd sack the Muses and get wedded;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in the country, blissful, horned,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in quilted dressing-gown adorned,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; life's real meaning would have found him;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at forty he'd have got the gout,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; drunk, eaten, yawned, grown weak and stout,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at length, midst children swarming round him,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; midst crones with endless tears to shed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and doctors, he'd have died in bed.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XL
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reader, whatever fate's direction,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we weep for the young lover's end,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the man of reverie and reflection,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the poet struck down by his friend!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Left-handed from the habitation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where dwelt this child of inspiration,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; two pines have tangled at the root;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beneath, a brook rolls its tribute
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; toward the neighbouring valley's river.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ploughman there delights to doze,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; girl reapers as the streamlet flows
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dip in their jugs; where shadows quiver
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; darkly above the water's lilt,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a simple monument is built.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {173}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Below it, when sprang rains are swishing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when, on the plain, green herbs are massed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the shepherd sings of Volga's fishing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and plaits a piebald shoe of bast;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the young city-bred newcomer,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who in the country spends her summer,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when galloping at headlong pace
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; alone across the fields of space,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will halt her horse and, gripping tightly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the leather rein, to learn the tale,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lift up the gauzes of her veil,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with a quick look perusing lightly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the simple legend -- then a haze
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of tears will cloud her tender gaze.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Walking her horse in introspection
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; across the plain's enormous room,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what holds her in profound reflection,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; despite herself, is Lensky's doom;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Olga,'' she thinks, ``what fate befell her?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her heartache, did it long compel her,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or did her grief soon find repair?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and where's her sister now? and where,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; flown from society as we know it,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of modish belles the modish foe,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where did that glum eccentric go,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the one who killed the youthful poet?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All in good time, on each point I
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will give you a complete reply.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {174}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But not today. Although I dearly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; value the hero of my tale,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; though I'll come back to him, yet clearly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to face him now I feel too frail...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The years incline to gloom and prosing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they kill the zest of rhymed composing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and with a sigh I now admit
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have to drag my feet to it.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My pen, as once, no longer hurries
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to spoil loose paper by the ream;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; another, a more chilling dream,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and other, more exacting worries,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in fashion's din, at still of night,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; come to disturb me and affright.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I've learnt the voice of new ambition,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I've learnt new sadness; but in this
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the first will never find fruition,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the earlier griefs are what I miss.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O dreams, o dreams, where is your sweetness?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where (standard rhyme) are youth and fleetness?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can it be true, their crown at last
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has felt time's desiccating blast?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can it be true, and firmly stated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; without an elegiac frill,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that spring with me has had its fill
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (as I've so oft in jest related)?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can it be true, it won't come twice --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and I'll be thirty in a trice?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {175}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, I must make a frank confession,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my noon is here, and that's the truth.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So let me with a kind expression
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; take leave of my lightheaded youth!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for all the gifts I treasure,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thank you for sorrow and for pleasure,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thank you for suffering and its joys,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for tempests and for feasts and noise;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thank you indeed. Alike in sorrow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in flat calm I've found the stuff
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of perfect bliss in you. Enough!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My soul's like crystal, and tomorrow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I shall set out on brand-new ways
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and rest myself from earlier days.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let me look back. Farewell, umbrageous
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; forests where my young age was passed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in indolence and in rampageous
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; passion and dreams of pensive cast.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But come, thou youthful inspiration,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; come, trouble my imagination,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; liven the drowsing of my heart,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fly to my corner like a dart,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; let not the poet's soul of passion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; grow cold, and hard, and stiff as stock,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and finally be turned to rock
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; amid the deadening joys of fashion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; amongst the soulless men of pride,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the fools who sparkle far and wide,<a href="#fn_11_6"><sup>6</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {176}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; amongst the crafty and small-minded,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the children spoilt, the mad, the rogues
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; both dull and ludicrous, the bunded
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; critics and their capricious vogues,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; amongst devout coquettes, appalling
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lickspittles who adore their crawling,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and daily scenes of modish life
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where civil treacheries are rife,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; urbane betrayals, and the chilling
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; verdicts of vanity the bleak,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; men's thoughts, their plots, the words they speak,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all of an emptiness so killing -- &gt;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that's the morass, I beg you note,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in which, dear friends, we're all afloat!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {177}
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By now the rays of spring are chasing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the snow from all surrounding hills;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it melts, away it rushes, racing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; down to the plain in turbid rills.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Smiling through sleep, nature is meeting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the infant year with cheerful greeting:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the sky is brilliant in its blue
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and, still transparent to the view,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the downy woods are greener-tinted;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from waxen cell the bees again
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; levy their tribute on the plain;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the vales dry out, grow brightly printed;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cows low, in the still nights of spring
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the nightingale's begun to sing.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {178}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; II
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O spring! o time for love! how sadly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your advent swamps me in its flood!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in my soul, o spring, how madly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your presence aches, and in my blood!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How heavy, and how near to sobbing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the bliss that fills me when your throbbing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; caressing breath has fanned my face
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in rural calm's most secret place!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or from all notion of enjoyment
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; am I estranged, does all that cheers,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that lives, and glitters, and endears,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now crush with sorrow's dull deployment
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a soul that perished long ago,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and finds the world a darkling show?
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; III
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or, unconsoled by the returning
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of leaves that autumn killed for good,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are we recalled to grief still burning
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by the new whisper in the wood?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or else does nature, fresh and staring,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set off our troubled mind comparing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its newness with our faded days,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with years no more to meet our gaze?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps, when thoughts are all a-quiver
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in midst of a poetic dream,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; some other, older spring will gleam,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and put our heart into a shiver
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with visions of enchanted night,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of distant countries, of moonlight...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {179}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's time: kind-hearted, idle creatures,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dons of Epicurean rule,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; calm men with beatific features,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; graduates of the Levshin<a href="#fn_12_1"><sup>1</sup></a> school,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Priam-like agricultural sages,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sensitive ladies of all ages --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the spring invites you to the land
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now warmth and blossom are on hand,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; field-work, and walks with inspiration,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and magic nights. In headlong course
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; come to the fields, my friends! To horse!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With mounts from home, or postal station,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in loaded carriages, migrate,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; leave far behind that city-gate.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; V
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forsake, indulgent reader -- driven
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in your <i>caleche</i> of foreign cast --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the untiring city, where you've given
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to feasts and fun this winter past;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and though my muse may be capricious,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we'll go with her to that delicious
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and nameless rivulet, that scene
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of whispering woods where my Eugene,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an idle monk in glum seclusion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has lately wintered, just a space
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from young Tatyana's dwelling-place,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dear Tanya, lover of illusion;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; though there he's no more to be found,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he's left sad footprints on the ground.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {180}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amidst the hills, down in that valley,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; let's go where, winding all the time
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; across green meadows, dilly-dally,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a brook flows through a grove of lime.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There sings the nightingale, spring's lover,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the wild rose blooms, and in the covert
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the source's chattering voice is heard;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and there a tombstone says its word
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where two old pinetrees stand united:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``This is Vladimir Lensky's grave
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who early died as die the brave'' --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the headpiece-text is thus indited --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the year, his age, then: ``may your rest,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; young poet, be for ever blest!''
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was a pine-branch downward straying
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; towards the simple urn beneath;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; time was when morning's breeze was swaying
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; over it a mysterious wreath:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; time was, in evening hours of leisure,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by moonlight two young girls took pleasure,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; closely embraced, in wending here,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to see the grave, and shed a tear.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today... the sad memorial's lonely,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; forgot. Its trodden path is now
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; choked up. There's no wreath on the bough;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; grey-haired and weak, beneath it only
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the shepherd, as he used to do,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sings as he plaits a humble shoe.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {181}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (VIII,<a href="#fn_12_2"><sup>2</sup></a> IX,) X
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poor Lensky! Set aside for weeping,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or pining, Olga's hours were brief.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas for him! there was no keeping
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his sweetheart faithful to her grief.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another had the skill to ravish
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her thoughts away, knew how to lavish
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sweet words by which her pain was banned --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a Lancer wooed and won her hand,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a Lancer -- how she deified him!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and at the altar, with a crown,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her head in modesty cast down,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; already there she stands beside him;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her eyes are lowered, but ablaze,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and on her lips a light smile plays.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poor Lensky! where the tomb is bounded
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by dull eternity's purlieus,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was the sad poet not confounded
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at this betrayal's fateful news?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or, as by Lethe's bank he slumbered,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; perhaps no more sensations lumbered
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the lucky bard, and as he dozed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the earth for him grew dumb and closed?...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On such indifference, such forgetting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beyond the grave we all must build --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; foes, friends and loves, their voice is stilled.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Only the estate provides a setting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for angry heirs, as one, to fall
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; into an unbecoming brawl.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {182}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Presently Olga's ringing answer
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inside the Larins' house fell mute.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Back to his regiment the Lancer,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; slave of the service, was <i>en route.</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Weltered in tears, and sorely smarting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the old dame wept her daughter's parting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in her grief seemed fit to die;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but Tanya found she couldn't cry:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; only the pallor of heart-breaking
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; covered her face. When all came out
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; onto the porch, and fussed about
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; over the business of leave-taking,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana went with them, and sped
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the carriage of the newly-wed.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And long, as if through mists that spurted,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tanya pursued them with her gaze...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So there she stood, forlorn, deserted!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The comrade of so many days,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; oh! her young dove, the natural hearer
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of secrets, like a friend but dearer,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had been for ever borne off far
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and parted from her by their star.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shade-like, in purposeless obsession
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she roams the empty garden-plot...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in everything she sees there's not
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a grain of gladness; tears' repression
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; allows no comfort to come through --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana's heart is rent in two.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {183}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her passion burns with stronger powder
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now she's bereft, and just the same
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her heart speaks to her even louder
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of far-away Onegin's name.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She'll not see him, her obligation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; must be to hold in detestation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the man who laid her brother low.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The poet's dead... already though
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no one recalls him or his verses;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by now his bride-to-be has wed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; another, and his memory's fled
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as smoke in azure sky disperses.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two hearts there are perhaps that keep
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a tear for him... but what's to weep?
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Evening, and darkening sky, and waters
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in quiet flood. A beetle whirred.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The choirs of dancers sought their quarters.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beyond the stream there smoked and stirred
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a fisher's fire. Through country gleaming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; silver with moonlight, in her dreaming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; profoundly sunk, Tatyana stalked
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for hours alone; she walked and walked...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suddenly, from a crest, she sighted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a house, a village, and a wood
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; below a hill; a garden stood
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; above a stream the moon had lighted.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She looked across, felt in her heart
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a faster, stronger pulsing start.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {184}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She hesitates, and doubts beset her:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; forward or back? it's true that he
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has left, and no one here has met her...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``The house, the park... I'll go and see!''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So down came Tanya, hardly daring
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to draw a breath, around her staring
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with puzzled and confused regard...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She entered the deserted yard.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dogs, howling, rushed in her direction...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her frightened cry brought running out
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the household boys in noisy rout;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; giving the lady their protection,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by dint of cuff and kick and smack
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they managed to disperse the pack.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Could I just see the house, I wonder?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana asked. The children all
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rushed to Anisia's room, to plunder
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the keys that opened up the hall.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At once Anisia came to greet her,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the doorway opened wide to meet her,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she went inside the empty shell
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in which our hero used to dwell.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She looks: forgotten past all chalking
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on billiard-table rests a cue,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and on the crumpled sofa too
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a riding whip. Tanya keeps walking...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``And here's the hearth,'' explains the crone,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``where master used to sit alone.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {185}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Here in the winter he'd have dinner
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with neighbour Lensky, the deceased.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please follow me. And here's the inner
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; study where he would sleep and feast
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on cups of coffee, and then later
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he'd listen to the administrator;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in morning time he'd read a book...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And just here, in the window-nook,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is where old master took up station,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and put his glasses on to see
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his Sunday game of cards with me.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pray God grant his soul salvation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and rest his dear bones in the tomb,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; down in our damp earth-mother's womb!''
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana in a deep emotion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gazes at all the scene around;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she drinks it like a priceless potion;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it stirs her drooping soul to bound
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in fashion that's half-glad, half-anguished:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that table where the lamp has languished,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beside the window-sill, that bed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on which a carpet has been spread,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; piled books, and through the pane the sable
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; moonscape, the half-light overall,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Byron's portrait on the wall,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the iron figure<a href="#fn_12_3"><sup>3</sup></a> on the table,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the hat, the scowling brow, the chest
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where folded arms are tightly pressed.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {186}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Longtime inside this modish cloister,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as if spellbound, Tatyana stands.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's late. A breeze begins to roister,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the valley's dark. The forest lands
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; round the dim river sleep; the curtain
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of hills has hid the moon; for certain
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the time to go has long since passed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the young pilgrim. So at last
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana, hiding her condition,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and not without a sigh, perforce
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sets out upon her homeward course;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before she goes, she seeks permission
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to come back to the hall alone
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and read the books there on her own.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Outside the gate Tatyana parted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with old Anisia. The next day
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at earliest morning out she started,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the empty homestead made her way,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then in the study's quiet setting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at last alone, and quite forgetting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the world and all its works, she wept
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and sat there as the minutes crept;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the books then underwent inspection...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at first she had no heart to range;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but then she found their choice was strange.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To reading from this odd collection
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana turned with thirsting soul:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and watched a different world unroll.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {187}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though long since Eugene's disapproval
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had ruled out reading, in their place
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and still exempted from removal
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a few books had escaped disgrace:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan's and the Giaour's creator,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; two or three novels where our later
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; epoch's portrayed, survived the ban,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; works where contemporary man
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is represented rather truly,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that soul without a moral tie,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all egoistical and dry,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to dreaming given up unduly,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and that embittered mind which boils
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in empty deeds and futile toils.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There many pages keep the impression
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where a sharp nail has made a dent.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On these, with something like obsession,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the girl's attentive eyes are bent.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana sees with trepidation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what kind of thought, what observation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had drawn Eugene's especial heed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and where he'd silently agreed.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her eyes along the margin flitting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pursue his pencil. Everywhere
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin's soul encountered there
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; declares itself in ways unwitting --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; terse words or crosses in the book,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or else a query's wondering hook.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {188}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so, at last, feature by feature,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tanya begins to understand
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; more thoroughly, thank God, the creature
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for whom her passion has been planned
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by fate's decree: this freakish stranger,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who walks with sorrow, and with danger,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whether from heaven or from hell,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this angel, this proud devil, tell,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what is he? Just an apparition,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a shadow, null and meaningless,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a Muscovite in Harold's dress,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a modish second-hand edition,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a glossary of smart <i>argot</i>...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a parodistic raree-show?
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can she have found the enigma's setting?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is this the riddle's missing clue?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Time races, and she's been forgetting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her journey home is overdue.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some neighbours there have come together;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they talk of her, of how and whether:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Tanya's no child -- it's past a joke,''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; says the old lady in a croak:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``why, Olga's younger, and she's bedded.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's time she went. But what can I
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; do with her when a flat reply
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; always comes back: I'll not be wedded.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then she broods and mopes for good,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and trails alone around the wood.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {189}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``She's not in love?'' ``There's no one, ever.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Buya;nov tried -- got flea in ear.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Ivan Petushko;v; no, never.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pikhti;n, of the Hussars, was here;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he found Tatyana so attractive,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bestirred himself, was devilish active!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I thought, she'll go this time, perhaps;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; far from it! just one more collapse.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``You don't see what to do? that's funny:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moscow's the place, the marriage-fair!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's vacancies in plenty there.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``My dear good sir, I'm short of money.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``One winter's worth, you've surely got;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or borrow, say, from me, if not.''
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The old dame had no thought of scouring
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; such good and sensible advice;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; accounts were done, a winter outing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to Moscow settled in a trice.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then Tanya hears of the decision.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To face society's derision
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with the unmistakeable sideview
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of a provincial <i>ingenue,</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to expose to Moscow fops and Circes
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her out-of-fashion turns of phrase,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; parade before their mocking gaze
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her out-of-fashion clothes!... oh, mercies!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no, forests are the sole retreat
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where her security's complete.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {190}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Risen with earliest rays of dawning,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tanya today goes hurrying out
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; into the fields, surveys the morning,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with deep emotion looks about
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and says: ``Farewell, you vales and fountains!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; farewell you too, familiar mountains!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Farewell, familiar woods! Farewell,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beauty with all its heavenly spell,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gay nature and its sparkling distance!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This dear, still world I must forswear
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for vanity, and din, and glare!...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Farewell to you, my free existence!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whither does all my yearning tend?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my fate, it leads me to what end?''
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She wanders on without direction.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Often she halts against her will,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; arrested by the sheer perfection
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she finds in river and in hill.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As with old friends, she craves diversion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in gossip's rambling and discursion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with her own forests and her meads...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the swift summer-time proceeds --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now golden autumn's just arriving.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now Nature's tremulous, pale effect
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; suggests a victim richly decked...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The north wind blows, the clouds are driving --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; amidst the howling and the blast
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sorceress-winter's here at last.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {191}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She's here, she spreads abroad; she stipples
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the branches of the oak with flock;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lies in a coverlet that ripples
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; across the fields, round hill and rock;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the bank, the immobile stream are levelled
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; beneath a shroud that's all dishevelled;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; frost gleams. We watch with gleeful thanks
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; old mother winter at her pranks.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Only from Tanya's heart, no cheering --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for her, no joy from winter-time,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she won't inhale the powdered rime,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor from the bath-house roof be clearing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; first snow for shoulders, breast and head:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for Tanya, winter's ways are dread.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Departure date's long overtaken;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at last the final hours arrive.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A sledded coach, for years forsaken,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; relined and strengthened for the drive;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; three carts -- traditional procession --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with every sort of home possession:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pans, mattresses, and trunks, and chairs,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and jam in jars, and household wares,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and feather-beds, and birds in cages,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with pots and basins out of mind,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and useful goods of every kind.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's din of parting now that rages,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with tears, in quarters of the maids:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and, in the yard, stand eighteen jades.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {192}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Horses and coach are spliced in marriage;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the cooks prepare the midday meal;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mountains are piled on every carriage,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and coachmen swear, and women squeal.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The bearded outrider is sitting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his spindly, shaggy nag. As fitting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to wave farewell the household waits
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the two ladies at the gates.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They're settled in; and crawling, sliding,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the grand barouche is on its way.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Farewell, you realms that own the sway
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of solitude, and peace abiding!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shall I see you?'' As Tanya speaks
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the tears in stream pour down her cheeks.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When progress and amelioration
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have pushed their frontiers further out,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in time (to quote the calculation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of philosophic brains, about
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; five hundred years) for sure our byways
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will blossom into splendid highways:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; paved roads will traverse Russia's length
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bringing her unity and strength;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and iron bridges will go arching
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; over the waters in a sweep;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mountains will part; below the deep,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; audacious tunnels will be marching:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Godfearing folk will institute
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an inn at each stage of the route.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {193}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now our roads are bad, the ages
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have gnawed our bridges, and the flea
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and bedbug that infest the stages
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; allow no rest to you or me;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inns don't exist; but in a freezing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; log cabin a pretentious-teasing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; menu, hung up for show, excites
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all sorts of hopeless appetites;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; meanwhile the local Cyclops, aiming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a Russian hammer-blow, repairs
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Europe's most finely chiselled wares
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before a fire too slowly flaming,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and blesses the unrivalled brand
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of ruts that grace our fatherland.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By contrast, in the frozen season,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how pleasantly the stages pass.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like modish rhymes that lack all reason,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the winter's ways are smooth as glass.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then our Automedons are flashing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our troikas effortlessly dashing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and mileposts grip the idle sense
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by flickering past us like a fence.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Worse luck, Larina crawled; the employment
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of her own horses, not the post,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; spared her the expense she dreaded most --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and gave our heroine enjoyment
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of traveller's tedium at its peak:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their journey took them a full week.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {194}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now they're near. Already gleaming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before their eyes they see unfold
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the towers of whitestone Moscow beaming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with fire from every cross of gold.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Friends, how my heart would leap with pleasure
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when suddenly I saw this treasure
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of spires and belfries, in a cup
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with parks and mansions, open up.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How often would I fall to musing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of Moscow in the mournful days
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of absence on my wandering ways!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moscow... how many strains are fusing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in that one sound, for Russian hearts!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what store of riches it imparts!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here stands, with shady park surrounded,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Petrovsky Castle; and the fame
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in which so lately it abounded
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rings proudly in that sombre name.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Napoleon here, intoxicated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with recent fortune, vainly waited
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; till Moscow, meekly on its knees,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gave up the ancient Kremlin-keys:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but no, my Moscow never stumbled
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor crawled in suppliant attire.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No feast, no welcome-gifts -- with fire
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the impatient conqueror was humbled!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From here, deep-sunk in pensive woe,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he gazed out on the threatening glow.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {195}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Farewell, Petrovsky Castle, glimmer
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of fallen glory. Well! don't wait,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; drive on! And now we see a-shimmer
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the pillars of the turnpike-gate;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; along Tverskaya Street already
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the potholes make the coach unsteady.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Street lamps go flashing by, and stalls,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; boys, country women, stately halls,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; parks, monasteries, towers and ledges,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bokharans, orchards, merchants, shacks,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; boulevards, chemists, and Cossacks,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; peasants, and fashion-shops, and sledges,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lions adorning gateway posts
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and, on the crosses, jackdaw hosts.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (XXXIX,<a href="#fn_12_2"><sup>2</sup></a>) XL
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This wearisome perambulation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; takes up an hour or two; at last
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the coach has reached its destination;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; after Saint Chariton's gone past
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a mansion stands just round a turning.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On an old aunt, who's long been burning
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with a consumption, they've relied.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And now the door is opened wide,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a grizzled Calmuck stands to meet them,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bespectacled, in tattered dress;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and from the salon the princess,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stretched on a sofa, calls to greet them.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The two old ladies kiss and cry;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thickly the exclamations fly.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {196}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Princess, <i>mon ange!</i>'' ``Pachette!'' ``Alina!''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Who would have thought it?'' ``What an age!''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``How long can you... ?'' ``Dearest <i>kuzina!</i>''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Sit down! how strange! it's like the stage
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or else a novel.'' ``And my daughter
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana's here, you know I've brought her...''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Ah, Tanya, come to me, it seems
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm wandering in a world of dreams...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grandison, cousin, d'you remember?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``What, Grandison? oh, Grandison!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I do, I do. Well, where's he gone?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Here, near Saint Simeon; in December,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on Christmas Eve, he wished me joy:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lately he married off his boy.''
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``As for the other one... tomorrow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we'll talk, and talk, and then we'll show
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tanya to all her kin. My sorrow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is that my feet lack strength to go
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; outside the house. But you'll be aching
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; after your drive, it's quite back-breaking;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; let's go together, take a rest...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, I've no strength... I'm tired, my chest...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These days I'm finding even gladness,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not only pain, too much to meet...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm good for nothing now, my sweet...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you age, and life's just grief and sadness...''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With that, in tears, and quite worn out,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she burst into a coughing-bout.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {197}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The invalid's glad salutation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her kindness, move Tatyana; yet
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the strangeness of her habitation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; after her own room, makes her fret.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No sleep, beneath that silken curtain,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in that new couch, no sleep for certain;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the early pealing of the bells
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lifts her from bed as it foretells
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the occupations of the morning.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She sits down by the window-sill.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The darkness thins away; but still
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no vision of her fields is dawning.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An unknown yard, she sees from thence,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a stall, a kitchen and a fence.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The kinsfolk in concerted action
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ask Tanya out to dine, and they
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; present her languor and distraction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to fresh grandparents every day.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For cousins from afar, on meeting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there never fails a kindly greeting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and exclamations, and good cheer.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``How Tanya's grown! I pulled your ear
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just yesterday.'' ``And since your christening
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how long is it?'' ``And since I fed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you in my arms on gingerbread?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all grandmothers who are listening
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in unison repeat the cry:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``My goodness, how the years do fly!''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {198}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Their</i> look, though, shows no change upon it --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they all still keep their old impress:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; still made of tulle, the self-same bonnet
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; adorns Aunt Helen, the princess;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; still powdered is Lukerya Lvovna,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a liar still, Lyubo;v Petrovna,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Iva;n Petro;vich still is dumb,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Semyo;n Petro;vich, mean and glum,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and then old cousin Pelageya
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; still has Monsieur Finemouche for friend,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; same Pom, same husband to the end;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>he's</i> at the club, a real stayer,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; still meek, still deaf as howd'youdo,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; still eats and drinks enough for two.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in their daughters' close embraces
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tanya is gripped. No comment's made
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at first by Moscow's youthful graces
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while she's from top to toe surveyed;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they find her somewhat unexpected,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a bit provincial and affected,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; too pale, too thin, but on the whole
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not bad at all; and then each soul
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gives way to nature's normal passion:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she's their great friend, asked in, caressed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her hands affectionately pressed;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they fluff her curls out in the fashion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in a singsong voice confide
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the inmost thoughts that girls can hide.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {199}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each others' and their own successes,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their hopes, their pranks, their dreams at night --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and so the harmless chat progresses
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; coated with a thin layer of spite.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then in return for all this twaddle,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from her they strive to coax and coddle
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a full confession of the heart.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana hears but takes no part;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as if she'd been profoundly sleeping,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there's not a word she's understood;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she guards, in silence and for good,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her sacred store of bliss and weeping
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as something not to be declared,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a treasure never to be shared.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To talk, to general conversation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana seeks to attune her ear,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but the salon's preoccupation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is with dull trash that can't cohere:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; everything's dim and unenthusing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; even the scandal's not amusing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in talk, so fruitless and so stale,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in question, gossip, news and tale,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not once a day a thought will quiver,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not even by chance, once in a while,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will the benighted reason smile,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; even in joke the heart won't shiver.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This world's so vacuous that it's got
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no spark of fun in all its rot!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {200}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In swarms around Tatyana ranging,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the modish Record Office clerks
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stare hard at her before exchanging
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; some disagreeable remarks.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One melancholy fop, declaring
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that she's ``ideal'', begins preparing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an elegy to her address,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; propped in the door among the press.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Once Vya;zemsky,<a href="#fn_12_4"><sup>4</sup></a> who chanced to find her
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at some dull aunt's, sat down and knew
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how to engage in talk that drew
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her soul's attention; just behind her
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an old man saw her as she came,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; straightened his wig, and asked her name.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; L
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But where, mid tragic storms that rend her,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Melpomene wails long and loud,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and brandishes her tinsel splendour
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before a cold, indifferent crowd,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and where Thalia, gently napping,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ignores approval's friendly clapping,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and where Terpsichore alone
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; moves the young watcher (as was known
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to happen long ago, dear readers,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in our first ages), from no place
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; did any glasses seek her face,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lorgnettes of jealous fashion-leaders,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or quizzing-glasses of know-alls
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in boxes or the rows of stalls.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {201}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They take her too to the Assembly.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The crush, the heat, as music blares,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the blaze of candles, and the trembly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; flicker of swiftly twirling pairs,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the beauties in their flimsy dresses,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the swarm, the glittering mob that presses,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the ring of marriageable girls --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bludgeon the sense; it faints and whirls.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here insolent prize-dandies wither
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all others with a waistcoat's set
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and an insouciant lorgnette.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hussars on leave are racing hither
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to boom, to flash across the sky,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to captivate, and then to fly.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The night has many stars that glitter,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moscow has beauties and to spare:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but brighter than the heavenly litter,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the moon in its azure of air.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet that goddess whom I'd never
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; importune with my lyre, whenever
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like a majestic moon, she drives
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; among the maidens and the wives,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how proudly, how divinely gleaming,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she treads our earth, and how her breast
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is in voluptuous languor dressed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how sensuously her eyes are dreaming!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Enough, I tell you, that will do --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you've paid insanity its due.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {202}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Noise, laughter, bowing, helter-skelter
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; galop, mazurka, waltz... Meanwhile
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; between two aunts, in pillared shelter,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unnoticed, in unseeing style,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tanya looks on; her own indictment
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; condemns the <i>monde</i> and its excitement;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she finds it stifling here... she strains
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in dream toward the woods and plains,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the country cottages and hovels,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and to that far and lonely nook
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where flows a little glittering brook,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to her flower-garden, to her novels, --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to where <i>he</i> came to her that time
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in twilight of <i>allees</i> of lime.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But while she roams in thought, not caring
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for dance, and din, and worldly ways,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a general of majestic bearing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has fixed on her a steady gaze.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The aunts exchanged a look, they fluttered,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they nudged Tatyana, and each muttered
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at the same moment in her ear:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Look quickly to the left, d'you hear?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Look to the left? where? what's the matter?''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``There, just in front of all that swarm,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you see the two in uniform...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just look, and never mind the chatter...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he's moved... you see him from the side.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Who? that fat general?'' Tanya cried.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {203}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But here, with our congratulation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on her conquest, we leave my sweet;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm altering my destination
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lest in forgetfulness complete
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I drop my hero... I'll be truthful:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``It is a friend I sing, a youthful
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; amateur of caprice and quirk.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Muse of the epic, bless my work!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in my long task, be my upholder,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; put a strong staff into my hand,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; don't let me stray in paths unplanned.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Enough. The load is off my shoulder!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I've paid my due to classic art:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it may be late, but it's a start.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {204}
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Days when I came to flower serenely
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in Lycee gardens long ago,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and read my Apuleius keenly,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but spared no glance for Cicero;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yes, in that spring-time, in low-lying
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; secluded vales, where swans were crying,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by waters that were still and clear,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the first time the Muse came near.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And suddenly her radiance lighted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my student cell: she opened up
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the joys of youth, that festal cup,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she sang of childhood's fun, indited
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Russia's old glories and their gleams,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the heart and all its fragile dreams.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {205}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; II
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with a smile the world caressed us:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what wings our first successes gave!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; aged Derzha;vin<a href="#fn_13_1"><sup>1</sup></a> saw and blessed us
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as he descended to the grave.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... ...
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; III
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The arbitrary rules of passion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; were all the law that I would use;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sharing her in promiscuous fashion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I introduced my saucy Muse
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to roar of banquets, din of brawling,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when night patrol's a perilous calling;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to each and every raving feast
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she brought her talents, never ceased,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bacchante-like, her flighty prancing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sang for the guests above the wine;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the youth of those past days in line
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; behind her followed wildly dancing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; among my friends, in all that crowd
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my giddy mistress made me proud.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {206}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I defected from their union
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and ran far off... the Muse came too.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How often, with her sweet communion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she'd cheer my wordless way, and do
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her secret work of magic suasion!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How often on the steep Caucasian
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ranges, Lenora<a href="#fn_13_2"><sup>2</sup></a>-like, she'd ride
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; breakneck by moonlight at my side!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How oft she'd lead me, by the Tauric
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; seacoast, to hear in dark of night
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the murmuring Nereids recite,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the deep-throated billows' choric
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hymnal as, endlessly unfurled,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they praise the Father of the world.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; V
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But then, oblivious of the city,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its glaring feasts, and shrill events,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in far Moldavia, fit for pity,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she visited the humble tents
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of wandering tribesmen; while the ravage
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of their society turned her savage,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she lost the language of the gods
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the bleak tongue of boorish clods --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she loved the steppe-land and its singing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then quickly something changed all this:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; look here, as a provincial miss
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she's turned up in my garden, bringing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sad meditations in her look,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and, in her hand, a small French book.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {207}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now for the first time she's escorted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; into the social whirlabout;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jealously, shyly, I've imported
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her steppeland charms into a <i>rout.</i><a href="#fn_13_3"><sup>3</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through the tight ranks -- aristocratic,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; military-foppish, diplomatic --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; past the grand ladies, see her glide;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she sits down calmly on one side,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; admires the tumult and the pressing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the flickering tones of dress and speech,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the young hostess, towards whom each
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; new guest is gradually progressing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while men, all sombre, all the same,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set off the ladies like a frame.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She enjoys the stately orchestration
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of oligarchical converse,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pride's icy calm, the combination
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of ranks and ages so diverse.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But who stands there, in this selected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; assembly, silent and dejected?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All who behold him find him strange.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Faces before him flash and change
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like irksome phantoms, null as zero.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is spleen his trouble, or the dumb
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; torment of pride? And why's he come?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who on earth is he? not... our hero?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt about it, it's Eugene.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``How long has he been on the scene?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {208}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still as he was? has he stopped prancing?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; does he still pose, and play the freak?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now he's returned, what role's he dancing?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what play will he present this week?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For what charade is he apparelled?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is he a Melmoth, a Childe Harold,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a patriot, a cosmopolite,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bigot or prude? or has he quite
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a different mask? is he becoming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; someone like you and me, just nice?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least I'll give him some advice:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to drop all that old-fashioned mumming;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; too long he's hoaxed us high and low...''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``You know him, do you?'' ``Yes and no.''
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However has he earned so vicious,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so unforgiving a report?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is it that we've become officious
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and prone to censure in our thought;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that fiery souls' headstrong enthusing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; appears offensive or amusing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the complacent and the null;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that wit embarrasses the dull;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that we enjoy equating chatter
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with deeds; that dunces now and then
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; take wing on spite; that serious men
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; find, in the trivial, serious matter;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that mediocre dress alone
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fits us as if it were our own?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {209}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; X
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blest he who in his youth was truly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; youthful, who ripened in his time,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and, as the years went by, who duly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; grew hardened to life's frosty clime;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who never learnt how dreamers babble;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who never scorned the social rabble;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at twenty, was a fop inbred,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at thirty, lucratively wed;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at fifty, would prolong the story
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by clearing every sort of debt;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who, in good time, would calmly get
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fortune, and dignity, and glory,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who all his life would garner praise
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as the perfection of our days!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, <i>our</i> youth was what we made it,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; something to fritter and to burn,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when hourly we ourselves betrayed it,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and it deceived us in return;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when our sublimest aspiration,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and all our fresh imagination,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; swiftly decayed beyond recall
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like foliage in the rotting fall.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's agony to watch the hollow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sequence of dinners stretch away,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to see life as a ritual play,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and with the decorous throng to follow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; although one in no manner shares
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its views, its passions, or its cares!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {210}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be a butt for the malicious
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is agony, if I may speak,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in the eyes of the judicious
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to pass for an affected freak,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or for a lamentable manic,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a monster of the <i>gens</i> Satanic,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or for that Demon<a href="#fn_13_4"><sup>4</sup></a> of my dream.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin -- now once more my theme --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had killed his best friend in a duel;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; without a goal on which to fix,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lived to the age of twenty-six;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was finding leisure's vacuum cruel;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and with no post, no work, no wife,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had nothing to employ his life.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was the slave of a tenacious,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a restless urge for change of place
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (an attribute that's quite vexatious,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; though some support it with good grace).
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He's gone away and left his village,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the solitude of woods and tillage,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where every day a bloodstained shade
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had come to him in field and glade;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; started a life of pointless roaming,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dogged by one feeling, only one --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and soon his travels had begun,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as all things did, to bore him; homing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like Chatsky,<a href="#fn_13_5"><sup>5</sup></a> he arrived to fall
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; direct from shipboard into ball.

<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There came a murmur, for a fleeting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; moment the assembly seemed to shake...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that lady the hostess was greeting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with the grand general in her wake --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she was unhurried, unobtrusive,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not cold, but also not effusive,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no haughty stare around the press,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no proud pretentions to success,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no mannerism, no affectation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no artifices of the vain...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No, all in her was calm and plain.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She struck one as the incarnation --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shishkov,<a href="#fn_13_6"><sup>6</sup></a> forgive me: I don't know
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Russian for <i>le comme il faut.</i>
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ladies came over, crossed to meet her,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dowagers smiled as she went by;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and bending deeply down to greet her
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; men made their bows, and sought her eye;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; girls as they passed her spoke less loudly,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and no one in the room so proudly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; raised nose and shoulders high and wide
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as did the general at her side.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You'd never class her as a beauty;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and yet in her you'd not detect --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rigorously though you'd inspect --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what London calls, with humble duty
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to fashion's absolute dictate,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a <i>vulgar</i> touch. I can't translate.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {212}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet, although it's past conveying,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I really dote upon the word:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it's new to us, beyond gainsaying;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from the first moment it was heard
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it had its epigram-potential<a href="#fn_13_7"><sup>7</sup></a>...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But let's return to our essential,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that lady whose engaging charm
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so effortlessly can disarm.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She sits with Nina<a href="#fn_13_8"><sup>8</sup></a> at a table --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bright Northern Cleopatra she:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but you'll undoubtedly agree
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that marble Nina's proved unable
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to steal away her neighbour's light
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or dim her, dazzle as she might.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Can it be she?'' Eugene in wonder
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; demanded. ``Yes, she looks... And yet...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from deepest backwood, furthest under...''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every minute his lorgnette
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stays fixed and focused on a vision
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which has recalled, without precision,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; forgotten features. ``Can you say,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; prince, who in that dark-red beret,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just there, is talking to the Spanish
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ambassador?'' In some surprise
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the prince looks at him, and replies:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Wait, I'll present you -- but you banish
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yourself too long from social life.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``But tell me who she is.'' ``My wife.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {213}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``You're married? No idea whatever...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since when is this?'' ``Two years or more.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``To...?'' ``Larina.'' ``Tatyana? never!''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``She knows you?'' ``Why, we lived next door.''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So to his wife for presentation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the prince bring up his own relation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and friend Evgeny. The princess
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gazes at him... and nonetheless,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; however much her soul has faltered,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; however strongly she has been
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; moved and surprised, she stays serene,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and nothing in her look is altered:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her manner is no less contained;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her bow, as calm and as restrained.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I don't mean that she never shivered,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; paled, flushed, or lost composure's grip --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no, even her eyebrow never quivered,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she never even bit her lip.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However closely he inspected,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; there was no trace to be detected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the old Tatyana. Eugene tried
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to talk to her, but language died.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How long he'd been here, was her query,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and where had he arrived from, not
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from their own country? Then she shot
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; across to her consort a weary
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; regard, and slipped away for good, ...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with Eugene frozen where he stood.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {214}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was she the Tanya he'd exhorted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in solitude, as at the start
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of this our novel we reported,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the far backwoods' deepest heart,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to whom, in a fine flow of preaching,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he had conveyed some moral teaching,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from whom he'd kept a letter, where
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her heart had spoken, free as air,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; untouched by trace of inhibition,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; could it be she... or had he dreamed?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the girl he'd scorned in what he deemed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the modesty of her condition,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; could it be she, who just had turned
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; away, so cool, so unconcerned?
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eugene forsakes the packed reception,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and home he drives, deep-sunk in thought.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By dreams now sad in their conception,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now sweet, his slumbers are distraught.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He wakes -- and who is this who writes him?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prince N. respectfully invites him
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to a <i>soiree.</i> ``My God! to her!...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'll go, I'll go!'' -- and in a stir
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a swift, polite reply is written.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What ails him? he's in some strange daze!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what moves along the hidden ways
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in one so slothful, so hard-bitten?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vexation? vainness? heavens above,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it can't be youth's distemper -- love?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {215}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Once more he counts the hour-bells tolling,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; once more he can't await the night;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now ten has struck, his wheels are rolling,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he drives there like a bird in flight,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he's up the steps, with heart a-quiver
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; led to the princess, all a-shiver,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; finds her alone, and there they sit
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; some minutes long. The words won't fit
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on Eugene's lips. In his dejection,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his awkwardness, he's hardly said
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a single thing to her. His head
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is lost in obstinate reflection;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and obstinate his look. But she
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sits imperturbable, and free.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her husband enters, thus concluding
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their unattractive <i>te;te-a;-te;te;</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he and Onegin start alluding
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to pranks and jokes of earlier date.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They laugh. The guests begin arriving.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Already now the talk was thriving
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on modish malice, coarse of grain
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but salt; near the princess a vein
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of unaffectedly fantastic
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; invention sparkled, then gave way
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to reasoned talk, no dull hearsay,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no deathless truths, nothing scholastic;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and no one's ear could take offence
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at such vivacious, free good sense.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {216}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; High rank, of course, and fashion's glasses,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saint Petersburg's fine flower was there --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the inevitable silly asses,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the faces met with everywhere;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ladies of riper years, delicious
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in rose-trimmed bonnets, but malicious;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a girl or two, without a smile
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to crack between them; for a while
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one listened to a chief of mission
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on state affairs; there was a wit,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a grey-haired, perfumed exquisite,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a joker in the old tradition,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; acute and subtle -- in a word
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all that today we find absurd.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There, with epigrammatic neatness,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was one who raged and raged again,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; against the tea's excessive sweetness,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the boring wives, the ill-bred men,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a novel, vague and superficial,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; two sisters who'd received the initial,<a href="#fn_13_9"><sup>9</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the lies that in the press run rife,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the war, the snowfall, and his wife.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... ...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {217}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was -- --,<a href="#fn_13_10"><sup>10</sup></a> so notorious
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; through baseness of the soul that he,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in albums, blunted the censorious
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cartoonist-pencils of Saint-Priest;<a href="#fn_13_11"><sup>11</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; another of the ball-dictators,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a fashion-plate for illustrators,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stood in the door, cherubic, mute,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; frozen in his tight-fitting suit;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a far-flung traveller who was creaking
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with foppery and too much starch,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set the guests smiling at his arch,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; affected pose -- and an unspeaking
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unanimous exchange of looks
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; entered his sentence in the books.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But my Eugene that night directed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his gaze at Tatyana alone --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not the plain, timorous, dejected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and lovelorn maiden whom he'd known,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but the unbending goddess-daughter
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of Neva's proud imperial water,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the imperturbable princess.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We all resemble more or less
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our Mother Eve: we're never falling
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for what's been given us to take;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to his mysterious tree the snake
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is calling us, for ever calling --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and once forbidden fruit is seen,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; no paradise can stay serene.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {218}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Tanya, what a transformation!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how well she'd studied her new role!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how soon the bounds of rank and station
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had won her loyalty! What soul
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; would have divined the tender, shrinking
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; maiden in this superb, unthinking
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lawgiver to the modish world?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet once for him her thoughts had whirled,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for him, at night, before the indulgence
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of Morpheus had induced relief
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she once had pined in girlish grief,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; raised a dull eye to moon's refulgence,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and dreamt that she with him one day
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jointly would tread life's humble way!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Love tyrannises all the ages;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but youthful, virgin hearts derive
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a blessing from its blasts and rages,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like fields in spring when storms arrive.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In passion's sluicing rain they freshen,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ripen, and find a new expression --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the vital force gives them the shoot
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of sumptuous flowers and luscious fruit.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But when a later age has found us,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the climacteric of our life,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how sad the scar of passion's knife:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as when chill autumn rains surround us,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; throw meadows into muddy rout,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and strip the forest round about.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {219}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, Eugene beyond all query
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is deep in love, just like a boy;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; spends light and darkness in the dreary
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; brooding that is the lover's ploy.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each day, despite the appeals of reason,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he drives up in and out of season
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to her glass porch; pursues her round
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; close as a shadow on the ground;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and bliss for him is when he hotly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; touches her hand, or throws a fur
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; around her neck, or when for her
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he goes ahead and parts the motley
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; brigade of liveries in the hall,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or else lifts up a fallen shawl.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But she refuses to perceive him,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; even if he drops or pines away.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At home she'll equably receive him,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in others' houses she may say
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a word or two, or stare unseeing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or simply bow: within her being
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; coquettishness has got no trace --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the <i>grand monde</i> finds it out of place.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile Onegin starts to languish:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she doesn't see, or doesn't mind;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin wastes, you'd almost find
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he's got consumption. In his anguish
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; some vote a doctor for the case,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; others prescribe a watering-place.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {220}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But go he won't: for him, a letter
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fixing an early rendezvous
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with his forefathers would seem better;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but she (for women, that's not new)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; remains unmoved: still he's persistent,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; active, and hopeful, and insistent:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his illness lends him courage and
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the princess, in his weak hand,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he sends a letter, penned with passion.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He deemed, in general, letters vain,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and rightly so, but now his pain
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had gone in no uncertain fashion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; past all endurance. You're referred
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to Eugene's letter, word for word.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {221}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin's Letter to Tatyana
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>``I know it all: my secret ache
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will anger you in its confession.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What scorn I see in the expression
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that your proud glance is sure to take!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What do I want? what am I after,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stripping my soul before your eyes!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know to what malicious laughter
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my declaration may give rise!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``I noticed once, at our chance meeting,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in you a tender pulse was beating,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yet dared not trust what I could see.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I gave no rein to sweet affection:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what held me was my predilection,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my tedious taste for feeling free.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then, to part us in full measure,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lensky, that tragic victim, died...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From all sweet things that gave me pleasure,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; since then my heart was wrenched aside;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; freedom and peace, in substitution
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for happiness, I sought, and ranged
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unloved, and friendless, and estranged.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What folly! and what retribution!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``No, every minute of my days,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to see you, faithfully to follow,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; watch for your smile, and catch your gaze
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with eyes of love, with greed to swallow
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your words, and in my soul to explore
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your matchlessness, to seek to capture
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its image, then to swoon before
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your feet, to pale and waste... what rapture!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {222}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``But I'm denied this: all for you
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I drag my footsteps hither, yonder;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I count each hour the whole day through;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and yet in vain</i> ennui <i>I squander
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the days that doom has measured out.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And how they weigh! I know about
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my span, that fortune's jurisdiction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has fixed; but for my heart to beat
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I must wake up with the conviction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that somehow that same day we'll meet...
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``I dread your stern regard surmising
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in my petition an approach,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a calculation past despising --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hear the wrath of your reproach.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How fearful, in and out of season
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to pine away from passion's thirst,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to burn -- and then by force of reason
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to stem the bloodstream's wild outburst;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how fearful, too, is my obsession
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to clasp your knees, and at your feet
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to sob out prayer, complaint, confession,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and every plea that lips can treat;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; meanwhile with a dissembler's duty
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to cool my glances and my tongue,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to talk as if with heart unwrung,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and look serenely on your beauty!...
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``But so it is: I'm in no state
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to battle further with my passion;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm yours, in a predestined fashion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and I surrender to my fate.</i>''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {223}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No answer comes. Another letter
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he sends, a second, then a third.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No answer comes. He goes, for better
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or worse, to a <i>soiree.</i> Unheard
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she appears before him, grim and frozen.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No look, no word for him: she's chosen
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to encase herself inside a layer
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of Twelfth Night's chillest, iciest air.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To batten down their indignation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is all those stubborn lips desire!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin looks with eyes of fire:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where are distress, commiseration?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No tearstains, nothing. Wrath alone
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is graven on that face of stone.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps some secret apprehension
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lest signs of casual weakness drew
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her husband's or the world's attention...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ah, all that my Onegin knew...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No hope! no hope! He leaves the revel,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wishes his madness to the devil,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; drives home -- and plunging deeper in,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; once more renounces world and din.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he remembers, in the quiet
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of his own room, how cruel spleen
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had once before, across the scene
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of social buzz and modish riot,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tracked him, and put him in duress,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and locked him in a dark recess.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {224}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Once more he turned to books, unchoosing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; devouring Gibbon and Rousseau,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Manzoni and Chamfort,<a href="#fn_13_12"><sup>12</sup></a> perusing
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Madame de Stae;l, Bichat,<a href="#fn_13_13"><sup>13</sup></a> Tissot,<a href="#fn_13_14"><sup>14</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Herder, and even at times a Russian --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nothing was barred beyond discussion --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he read of course the sceptic Bayle<a href="#fn_13_15"><sup>15</sup></a>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and all the works of Fontanelle<a href="#fn_13_16"><sup>16</sup></a> --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; almanacs, journals of reflection,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where admonitions are pronounced,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where nowadays I'm soundly trounced,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but where such hymns in my direction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; were chanted, I remember when --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>e sempre bene,</i> gentlemen.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What happened? Though his eyes were reading,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his thoughts were on a distant goal:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; desires and dreams and griefs were breeding
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and swarming in his inmost soul.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between the lines of text as printed,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his mind's eye focused on the hinted
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; purport of other lines; intense
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; was his absorption in their sense.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Legends, and mystical traditions,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; drawn from a dim, warm-hearted past,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dreams of inconsequential cast,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rumours and threats and premonitions,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; long, lively tales from wonderland,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or letters in a young girl's hand.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {225}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then gradually upon sensation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and thought, a sleepy numbness steals;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before his eyes, imagination
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; brings out its faro pack, and deals.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sees: in slush, stretched out and keeping
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; motionless as one soundly sleeping
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in bed, a young man, stiff and chilled;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he hears a voice; ``well, what? he's killed!''
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And foes he sees, long-since forgotten,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a rogue, a slanderer, a poltroon,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; young traitresses by the platoon,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; comrades despised, and comrades rotten;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a country house -- and <i>one</i> who still
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sits there beside the window-sill!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He got so used to this immersion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he almost lost his mind, expired,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or joined us poets. His conversion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; would have been all that we required!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's true, the magnet-like attraction
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of Russian verse, its force in action, --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my inept pupil, at that hour,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so nearly had them in his power.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who could have looked the poet better,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as in the nook he'd sit alone
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by blazing fireplace, and intone
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Idol mio</i> or <i>Benedetta,</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and on the flames let fall unseen
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a slipper, or a magazine?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {226}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The days flew past; by now the season
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in warmer airs was half dispersed.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He's neither died, nor lost his reason,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nor turned a poet. In the burst
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of spring he lives, he's energetic;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he leaves one morning the hermetic
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; apartment where a double glaze
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has kept him warm in chimney's blaze
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while, marmot-like, he hibernated --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; along the Neva in a sleigh,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; past ice-blocks, blue and squared away,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he drives in brilliant sun; striated
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; along the street lies dirty snow;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and like an arrow from a bow
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XL
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; over the slush, where is he chasing?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You've guessed before it all began:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to his Tatyana, yes, he's racing,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my strange, incorrigible man.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He goes inside, corpse-like of feature...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the hall's without a living creature,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the big room, further, not a cat.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He opens up a door. What's that
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that strikes him with such force and meaning?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The princess, sitting peaked and wan,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; alone, with no adornment on;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she holds a letter up, and leaning
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cheek upon hand she softly cries
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in a still stream that never dries.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {227}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who in that flash could not have reckoned
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her full account of voiceless pain?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who in the princess for that second
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; would not have recognized again
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our hapless Tanya! An emotion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of wild repentance and devotion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; threw Eugene at her feet -- she stirred,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and looked at him without a word,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; without surprise or rage... his laden,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his humbly suppliant approach,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his dull, sick look, his dumb reproach --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she sees it all. The simple maiden,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whose heart on dreams was wont to thrive,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in her once more has come alive.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana leaves Onegin kneeling,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; looks at him with a steady gaze,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; allows her hand, that's lost all feeling,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to meet his thirsty lips... What daze,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what dream accounts for her distraction?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A pause of silence and inaction,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then quietly at last says she:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Enough, stand up. It's now for me
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to give you honest explanation.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin, d'you recall the day
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when in the park, in the <i>allee</i>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where fate had fixed our confrontation,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; humbly I heard your lesson out?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today it's turn and turn about.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {228}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``For then, Onegin, I was younger,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and also prettier, I'll be bound,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what's more, I loved you; but my hunger,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what was it in your heart it found
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that could sustain it? Only grimness;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for you, I think, the humble dimness
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of lovelorn girls was nothing new?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now -- oh God! -- the thought of you,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your icy look, your stern dissuasion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; freezes my blood... Yet all the same,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nothing you did gave cause for blame:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you acted well, that dread occasion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you took an honourable part --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm grateful now with all my heart.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLIV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Then, in the backwoods, far from rumour
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and empty gossip, you'll allow,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'd nothing to attract your humour...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why then do you pursue me now?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What cause has won me your attention?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could it not be that by convention
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I move in the <i>grand monde</i>? that rank,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and riches, and the wish to thank
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my husband for his wounds in battle
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; earn us the favour of the Court?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that, for all this, my shame's report
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; would cause widespread remark and tattle,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and so in the <i>salons</i> could make
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a tempting plume for you to take?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {229}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLV
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``I weep... In case there still should linger
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your Tanya's image in your mind,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then know that your reproving finger,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your cold discourse, were less unkind --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if I had power to choose your fashion --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than this humiliating passion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and than these letters, and these tears.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least you then showed for my years
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; respect, and mercy for my dreaming.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now! what brings you to my feet?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What trifling could be more complete?
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What power enslaves you, with your seeming
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; advantages of heart and brain,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to all that's trivial and inane?
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLVI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``To me, Onegin, all this glory
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is tinsel on a life I hate;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this modish whirl, this social story,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my house, my evenings, all that state --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what's in them? All this loud parading,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and all this flashy masquerading,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the glare, the fumes in which I live,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this very day I'd gladly give,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; give for a bookshelf, a neglected
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; garden, a modest home, the place
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of our first meeting face to face,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the churchyard where, new-erected,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a humble cross, in woodland gloom,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stands over my poor nurse's tomb.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {230}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLVII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``Bliss was so near, so altogether
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; attainable!... But now my lot
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is firmly cast. I don't know whether
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I acted thoughtlessly or not:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you see, with tears and incantation
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mother implored me; my sad station
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; made all fates look the same... and so
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I married. I beseech you, go;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know your heart: it has a feeling
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for honour, a straightforward pride.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I love you (what's the use to hide
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; behind deceit or double-dealing?)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but I've become another's wife --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and I'll be true to him, for life.''
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLVIII
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She went -- and Eugene, all emotion,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stood thunder-struck. In what wild round
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of tempests, in what raging ocean
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his heart was plunged! A sudden sound,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the clink of rowels, met his hearing;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tatyana's husband, now appearing...
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But from the hero of my tale,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; just at this crisis of his gale,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reader, we must be separating,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for long... for evermore. We've chased
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; him far enough through wild and waste.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hurrah! let's start congratulating
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ourselves on our landfall. It's true,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; our vessel's long been overdue.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {231}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XLIX
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reader, I wish that, as we parted --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whoever you may be, a friend,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a foe -- our mood should be warm-hearted.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Goodbye, for now we make an end.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever in this rough confection
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you sought -- tumultuous recollection,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a rest from toil and all its aches,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or just grammatical mistakes,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a vivid brush, a witty rattle --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God grant that from this little book
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for heart's delight, or fun, you took,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for dreams, or journalistic battle,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God grant you took at least a grain.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On this we'll part; goodbye again!
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; L
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And my companion, so mysterious,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; goodbye to you, my true ideal,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my task, so vivid and so serious
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and yet so light. All that is real
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and enviable for a poet,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in your pursuit I've come to know it:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; oblivion of life's stormy ways,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sweet talk with friends. How many days
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; since, through the mist that dreams arise on,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; young Tanya first appeared to me,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Onegin too -- and there to see,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a free romance's far horizon,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; still dim, through crystal's magic glass,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before my gaze began to pass.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {232}
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LI
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of those who heard my opening pages
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in friendly gatherings where I read,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as Sadi<a href="#fn_13_17"><sup>17</sup></a> sang in earlier ages,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``some are far distant, some are dead''.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They've missed Eugene's completed etching.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But she who modelled for the sketching
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of Tanya's image... Ah, how great
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the toll of those borne off by fate!
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blest he who's left the hurly-burly
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of life's repast betimes, nor sought
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to drain its beaker down, nor thought
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of finishing its book, but early
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has wished it an abrupt goodbye --
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and, with my Eugene, so have I.
